In the spring of 2013, the Commonwealth of Virginia, through the Virginia Geographic Information Network Division (herein referred to as VGIN) of the Virginia Information Technologies Agency (VITA) contracted with the Sanborn Map Company to provide Aerial data acquisition, ground control, aerotriangulation and development of statewide DTM and digital orthophotography data. The Virginia Base Mapping Program (VBMP) update project is divided into two collection phases: the Eastern half was collected in Spring 2013 and the Western half will be collected Spring 2015. The entire project encompasses the entire land area of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The State boundary is buffered by 1000\\'. Coastal areas of the State bordering the Atlantic Ocean or the Chesapeake Bay shall be buffered by 1000\\' or the extent of man-made features extending from shore. The entire State was intially designed to support 1\"=200\\' (1:2400) scale mapping. Jurisdictions throughout the State were provided an option to upgrade to a 1\"=100\\' map scale. All data development processes for the DTM conform to the ASPRS Draft Aerial Photography Standards (1995) and Model Virginia Map Accuracy Standards (1992), which generally follow the ASPRS Accuracy Standard for Large-Scale Mapping (1990) for relevant mapping scales. The DTM supports the creation of 3-inch, 6-inch or 1-foot map orthoimagery at the relevant scales.  The vertical datum used was NAVD 1988.',\n",

In the spring of 2013, the Commonwealth of Virginia, through the Virginia Geographic Information Network Division (herein referred to as VGIN) of the Virginia Information Technologies Agency (VITA) contracted with the Sanborn Map Company to provide Aerial data acquisition, ground control, aerotriangulation and development of statewide DTM and digital orthophotography data. The Virginia Base Mapping Program (VBMP) update project is divided into two collection phases: the Eastern half was collected in Spring 2013 and the Western half will be collected Spring 2015. The entire project encompasses the entire land area of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The State boundary is buffered by 1000\\'. Coastal areas of the State bordering the Atlantic Ocean or the Chesapeake Bay shall be buffered by 1000\\' or the extent of man-made features extending from shore. The entire State was intially designed to support 1\"=200\\' (1:2400) scale mapping. Jurisdictions throughout the State were provided an option to upgrade to a 1\"=100\\' map scale. All data development processes for the DTM conform to the ASPRS Draft Aerial Photography Standards (1995) and Model Virginia Map Accuracy Standards (1992), which generally follow the ASPRS Accuracy Standard for Large-Scale Mapping (1990) for relevant mapping scales. The DTM supports the creation of 3-inch, 6-inch or 1-foot map orthoimagery at the relevant scales.  The vertical datum used was NAVD 1988.',\n",

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\\n\\n\\nThe primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties.  In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes.  In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas.  The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau.  In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their states.  These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation.  The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation.  The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities.  \\n\\n\\nThe boundaries for counties and equivalent entities are mostly as of January 1, 2013, primarily as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).  However, some changes made after January 2013, including the addition and deletion of counties, are included.\\n\",\n",

MODIS Global Fires is a product of NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS), part of NASA's Earth Science Data. EOSDIS integrates remote sensing and GIS technologies to deliver global MODIS hotspot/fire locations to natural resource managers and other stakeholders around the World.Source:NASA FIRMS - Active Fire Data - for WorldScale/Resolution:1kmUpdate Frequency:1/2 Hour (every 30 minutes) using the Aggregated Live Feed MethodologyArea Covered:WorldWhat can I do with this layer?The MODIS thermal activity layer can be used to visualize and assess wildfires worldwide. However, it should be noted that this dataset contains many “false positive” (e.g., oil/natural gas wells or volcanoes) since the satellite will detect any large thermal signal.Additional Information:MODIS stands for MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. The MODIS instrument is on board NASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites. The orbit of the Terra satellite goes from north to south across the equator in the morning and Aqua passes south to north over the equator in the afternoon resulting in global coverage every 1 to 2 days. The EOS satellites have a ±55 degree scanning pattern and orbit at 705 km with a 2,330 km swath width.It takes approximately 2 – 4 hours after satellite overpass for MODIS Rapid Response to process the data, and for the Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) to update the website. Occasionally, hardware errors mean that it takes longer than the 2-4 hours to process the data. Additional information on the MODIS system status can be found at MODIS Rapid Response.Attribute Information:Latitude and Longitude: The center point location of the 1km (approx.) pixel flagged as containing one or more fires/hotspots (fire size is not 1km, but variable). See What does a hotspot/fire detection mean on the ground?Brightness: The brightness temperature measured (in Kelvin) using the MODIS channels 21/22 and channel 31.Scan and Track: The actual spatial resolution of the scanned pixel. Although the algorithm works at 1km resolution, the MODIS pixels get bigger toward the edge of the scan. See What does scan and track mean?Date: Acquisition date of the hotspot/active fire pixel.Time: Time of the overpass of the satellite (in UTC).Satellite: Whether the detection was picked up by the Terra or Aqua satellite.Confidence: The detection confidence is a quality flag of the individual hotspot/active fire pixel.Version: Version refers to the processing collection and source of data. The number before the decimal refers to the collection (e.g. MODIS Collection 6). The number after the decimal indicates the source of Level 1B data; data processed in near-real time by MODIS Rapid Response will have the source code “CollectionNumber.0”. Data sourced from MODAPS (with a 2-month lag) and processed by FIRMS using the standard MOD14/MYD14 Thermal Anomalies algorithm will have a source code “CollectionNumber.x”. For example, data with the version listed as 5.0 is collection 5, processed by MRR, data with the version listed as 5.1 is collection 5 data processed by FIRMS using Level 1B data from MODAPS.Bright.T31: Channel 31 brightness temperature (in Kelvins) of the hotspot/active fire pixel.FRP: Fire Radiative Power. Depicts the pixel-integrated fire radiative power in MW (MegaWatts). FRP provides information on the measured radiant heat output of detected fires. The amount of radiant heat energy liberated per unit time (the Fire Radiative Power) is thought to be related to the rate at which fuel is being consumed (Wooster et. al. (2005)).This map is provided for informational purposes and is not monitored 24/7 for accuracy and currency.\",\n",

       "  'dc_description_s': '\\n    On September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria hit the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico as a category 4 storm. Heavy rainfall caused landslides in mountainous regions throughout the territory. This data release presents geospatial data describing the concentration of landslides generated by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. We used post-hurricane satellite and aerial imagery collected between September 26, 2017 and October 8, 2017 to visually estimate the number of landslides over nearly the whole territory. This was done by dividing the territory into a grid with 4 km2 cells (2 km x 2 km).  Each 4 km2 grid cell was classified as either containing no landslides, fewer than 25 landslides/km2 or more than 25 landslides/km2. We used 12 WorldView satellite images (~0.5 m-resolution) available from Digital Globe, Inc. and ~0.15 m-resolution aerial imagery collected by Sanborn and QuantumSpatial (http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=b1949283c1084b0daf2987d896392ac2). Because leaves were stripped from much of the vegetation, landslide scars were readily visible in both sources of imagery. We assume that the majority of landslides were triggered by rainfall from Hurricane Maria, but rainfall from Hurricane Irma during the first week of September and rainfall from thunderstorms after Hurricane Maria may have also initiated landslides.  \\n    During this investigation, we visually examined a total area of 8103 km2, which encompassed most of the territory and nearly all the mountainous areas. Approximately 846 km2 of the land area of the territory was not examined because either 1) imagery was unavailable or 2) the area was obscured by cloud cover. Approximately 61% of the examined area was unaffected by landslides. Landslides were observed in the remaining 39% of the examined area, but, for the most part , the landslide density was less than 25 landslides/km2 (37% of the examined area). Landslide density was greater than 25 landslides/km2 in about 2% of the examined area (156 km2), which includes parts of the Añasco, Mayagüez, Las Marías, Maricao, Lares, Utuado, Adjuntas, and Jayuya municipalities. Based on visual examination of imagery, the municipality of Utuado appears to have been the most severely impacted, with about 40% of the municipality having a density of landslides greater than 25 landslides/km2. This preliminary assessment serves to inform response and recovery efforts and as a basis for more detailed studies on the impacts of landslides in Puerto Rico caused by Hurricane Maria.\\n   ',\n",

The original data used to create this database are the pre-2008 Farm Bill FSA common land unit (CLU) datasets. A portion of metadata found herein pertains to the USDA FSA CLU. The remaining information has been developed to reflect the repurposing of the data in its aggregated form. It is important to note that all USDA programmatic and ownership information that was associated with the original data have been removed. Beyond that, these data has been extensively edited to reflect crop-specific land use consistent with 2009 land cover as derived from 2009 NASS Crop Data Layer datasets and 2009 aerial photography, and no longer reflects discrete ownership patterns.FSA: The common land unit (CLU) dataset consists of digitized farm tract and field boundaries and associated attribute data. The USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) defines farm fields as agricultural land that is delineated by natural and man-made boundaries such as road ways, tree lines, waterways, fence lines, etc. Field boundaries are visible features that can be identified and delineated on aerial photography and digital imagery. Farm tracts are defined by FSA as sets of contiguous fields under single ownership. Common land units are used to administer USDA farm commodity support and conservation programs in a GIS environment. The CLU data set was prepared by digitizing farm tracts and fields using 1:7920 scale rectified photomaps that have been maintained by FSA in USDA Field Service Centers. Using the photomaps as reference tract and field boundaries were digitized on-screen with digital orthophotography using ESRIs (Environmental Systems Research Institute) ArcView GIS Product. Each of the boundaries of the CLU are digitized to a tolerance of 3 meters (approximately 10 feet) from ground features visible on the digital orthophotograph. The base ortho imagery was produced by mosaicking digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQs) into a seamless county image. The CLU were digitized from an image base of digital ortho quadrangles mosaiked together creating a seamless image base. The moasaicking process eliminates or minimizes any offset that would normally be present between standard USGS quarter quadrangles. CLU datasets are projected in the UTM coordinate system, NAD 83.',\n",

Contours were collected to represent the elevation of the area. These contours were accompanied by hydro-flattened Bare Earth DEMs and breaklines. Geographic Extent: AOI was located in Eastern Nebraska over Douglas, Sarpy, and Lancaster Counties. The area of interest covered approximately 1,789 square miles. Dataset Description: NE Nebraska Urban Area Lidar_2016 QL2 Lidar project called for the Planning, Acquisition, processing and derivative products of lidar data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.70 meter. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Lidar Base Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 (2011), Nebraska State Plane (FIPS 2600), U.S. Survey Feet and vertical datum of NAVD88 (GEOID12B), Feet. Lidar data was delivered as; flightline-extent raw LAS v1.4 swaths, classified point cloud LAS v1.4 files formatted to 2,380 individual 5000' x 5000' tiles in NAD83 (2011) Nebraska State Plane (FIPS 2600). Derivatives were produced as tiled; Bare Earth Surface DEMs, Digital Surface Models, Intensity Images; all tiled to the same 5000’ x 5000’ schema. Ground Conditions: Lidar was collected in winter of 2016/17 by Aerial Services, Inc. (ASI), while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Woolpert established a total of 33 ground control points that were used to calibrate the lidar to known ground locations established throughout the project area. Additional independent accuracy checkpoints were collected (76 NVA points and 55 VVA points) and used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data.\",\n",

The map legend is based on classification of the plots and follows the hierarchical National Vegetation Classification System (USGS-NPS 2005) and Manual of California (Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf 1995). Types are cross-walked to California Wildlife Habitat Relationships (CWHR) and Holland types. No report was produced; this metadata serves to document the entire project. WHAT EACH RECORD REPRESENTS: Each record represents the attributes of the individual polygon in the map layer, including vegetation type, structural information, and disturbance information. The map represents vegetation as it existing prior to the 2002 Pines Fire. Polygons are attributed to the lowest level of the classification hierarchy allowed by the image resolution and comfort level of the photo interpreter. Thus, individual polygons are mapped to the Formation, Alliance or Association level. Several \"mapping units\" not in the vegetation classification were also used in the mapping classification (=map legend). The hierarchical classification and crosswalk allow mapping at coarser levels or in different systems (e.g., CWHR). If mapping at the Formation level (the \"1000s\" in the spreadsheet), please consider including the California juniper types 2106, 2171, 2172 and 2173 in the 4000s (Evergreen Shrubland). This juniper is considered a tree in the national classification, but is more shrub-like and its desert affinities make California juniper types fit more logically into the Evergreen Shrubland Formation.',\n",

       "  'dc_description_s': \"This layer was developed by the Research &amp; Analytics Division of the Atlanta Regional Commission and is a generalized landcover database designed for Regional Planning.  Although it has a landuse component which is used for forecasts and modeling at ARC, outside users should be aware that the landcover and landuse delineations are based on photo-interpretation of a 5-acre and 25-acre minimum mapping unit respectively, not parcels.  Likewise, LandPro2003 should not be taken out of its Regional context, though county-level or municipal-level analysis may be useful for transportation, environmental and landuse planning.Though the terms are often used interchangeably, landuse and landcover are not synonymous.\\xa0 Landcover generally refers to the natural or cultivated vegetation, rock, or water covering the land, as well as the developed surface which can be identified on aerial photography.\\xa0 Landuse generally refers to the way that humans use or will use the land, regardless of its apparent landcover.\\xa0 Collateral data for the landcover mapping effort included the Aero Surveys of Georgia street atlas, the Georgia Department of Community Affairs (DCA) Community Facilities database and the USGS Digital Raster Graphics (DRGs) of 1:24,000 scale topographic maps.\\xa0 The landuse component of this database was added after the landcover interpretation was completed, and is based primarily on ownership information provided by the 13 counties and the City of Atlanta for larger tracts of undeveloped land that meet the landuse definition of &quot;Extensive Institutional&quot; or &quot;Park Lands&quot; (refer to the Code Descriptions and Discussion section below).\\xa0 Although some of the boundaries of these tracts may align with visible features from the aerial photography, these areas are generally &quot;non-photo-identifiable,&quot; thus require other sources for accurate identification.\\xa0 The minimum mapping unit standard for this database is generally 5 acres, with varying exceptions based on category and context.\\xa0 Some smaller Intensive Institutional (mostly elementary schools), Commercial, Cemeteries, and Reservoirs (impoundments) have been intentionally delineated in some cases throughout the Region.\\xa0 Within the downtown and midtown areas, many small polygons of multi-family residential have been identified and added with this 2003 update through research of mostly web-based resources.\\xa0 Within single-family neighborhoods, differentiation of adjacent residential areas (111-low density, 112-medium density, and 113-high density) is generally 25 acres, and within agricultural areas, delineation of some forested areas (Code 40) is occasionally larger.\\xa0 25 acres is also the minimum mapping consideration for the landuse categories of Extensive Institutional (Code 125) and Park Lands (Code 175).\\xa0 The landuse/cover classification system is adapted from the USGS (Anderson) classification system, incorporating a mix of level I, II and III classes.\\xa0 There are a total of 28 categories in ARC's landuse/cover system (described below), 2 of which are used only for landuse designations: Park Lands (Code 175) and Extensive Institutional (Code 125).\\xa0 The other 26 categories can describe landuse and/or landcover, and in most cases will be the same.\\xa0 The LU code will differ from the LC code only where the Park Lands (Code 175) and Extensive Institutional (Code 125) land holdings have been identified from collateral sources of land ownership.Although similar to previous eras of ARC landuse/cover databases developed before 1999 (1995, 1990 etc.), &quot;LandPro&quot; differs in many significant ways. Originally, ARC's landuse and landcover database was built from 1975 data complied by USGS at scales of 1:100,000 and selectively, 1:24,000.\\xa0 The coverage was updated in 1990 using SPOT satellite imagery and low-altitude aerial photography and again in 1995 using 1:24,000 scale panchromatic aerial photography.\\xa0 Unlike these previous 5-year updates, the 1999, 2001 and now 2003 LandPro databases were compiled at a larger scale (1:14,000) and do not directly reflect pre-1999 delineations.\\xa0 In addition, all components of LandPro were produced using digital orthophotos for on-screen photo-interpretation and digitizing, thus eliminating the use of unrectified photography and the need for data transfer and board digitizing.\\xa0 As a result, the positional accuracy of LandPro is much higher than in previous eras.\\xa0 There have also been some changes to the classification system prior to 1999.\\xa0 Previously, three categories of Forest (41-deciduous, 42-coniferous, and 43-mixed forest) were used; this version does not distinguish between coniferous and deciduous forest, thus Code 40 is used to simply designate Forest.\\xa0 Likewise, two categories of Wetlands (61-forested wetland, and 62-non-forested wetland) were used before; this version does not distinguish between forested and non-forested wetlands, thus Code 60 is used to simply designate Wetlands.\\xa0 With regard to Wetlands, the boundaries themselves are now based on the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) delineations along with the CIR imagery.\\xa0 Furthermore, Code 51 has been renamed &quot;Rivers&quot; from &quot;Streams and Canals&quot; and represents the Chattahoochee River which has been identified in the landuse/cover database.\\xa0 In addition to these changes, Code 52 has been dropped from the system as there are no known instances of naturally occurring lakes in the Region. Finally, the landuse code for Park Lands has been changed from 173 to 175 so as to minimize confusion with the Parks landcover code, 173.\\xa0 Due to new technology and the enhancements to this database, direct comparison between LandPro99, LandPro2001 and LandPro2003 is now possible, with the 1999 database serving as ARC's new baseline.\\xa0 Please note that as a result of the 2003 mapping effort, LandPro2001 has been adjusted for better comparison to LandPro2003 and is named &quot;LandPro01_adj.&quot;\\xa0 Lilkewise, LandPro99 was previously adjusted when LandPro2001 was completed, but was not further adjusted following the 2003 update.\\xa0 Although some adjustments were originally made to the 1995 landuse/cover database for modeling applications, direct comparisons to previous versions of ARC landuse/cover before 1999 should be avoided in most cases.Classification System:111:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Low Density Single Family Residential - Areas that have generally been developed for single family residential use, usually with a significant mix of forested or agricultural landcover.\\xa0 These areas often occur on the periphery of urban expansion and are generally characterized by houses on 2 to 5 acre lots.\\xa0 Some examples of this category include rural housing, estates, and linear residential developments along transportation routes.112:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Medium Density Single Family Residential - Areas that have predominantly been developed for single family residential use, with or without a significant mix of forested or agricultural landcover.\\xa0 These areas usually occur in urban or suburban zones and are generally characterized by houses on 1/4 to 2 acre lots.\\xa0 This category accounts for the majority of residential landuse in the Region and includes a wide variety of neighborhood types.113:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 High Density Residential - Areas that have predominantly been developed for concentrated single family residential use.\\xa0 These areas occur almost exclusively in urban neighborhoods with streets on a grid network, and are characterized by houses on lots smaller than 1/4 acre, but may also include mixed residential areas with duplexes and small apartment buildings.117:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Multifamily Residential - Residential areas comprised predominantly of apartment, condominium and townhouse complexes where net density generally exceeds eight units per acre.\\xa0 Typical apartment buildings are relatively easy to identify, but some high rise structures may be interpreted as, or combined with, office buildings, though many of these dwellings were identified and delineated in downtown and midtown for the first time with the 2003 update.\\xa0 Likewise, some smaller apartments and townhouses may be interpreted as, or combined with, medium- or high-density single family residential.\\xa0 Housing on military bases, campuses, resorts, agricultural properties and construction work sites is not included in this or other residential categories.119:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mobile Home Parks - Areas that have been developed for single family mobile home use. These residential areas may occur in urban, suburban, or rural zones throughout the Region, with or without a significant mix of forested landcover.\\xa0 Due to their sparse distribution, individual mobile homes are generally mapped with the Forest landcover (Code 40) and Low- or Medium-Density Residential (Codes 111 and 112, respectively).12:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Commercial and Services - Areas used predominantly for the sale of products and services, including urban central business districts, shopping centers in suburban and outlying areas, commercial strip developments, junk yards and resorts.\\xa0 The main buildings, secondary structures and areas supporting the basic use are all included: office buildings, warehouses, driveways, sheds, parking lots, landscaped areas, waste disposal areas, etc.\\xa0 Commercial areas may include some non-commercial uses too small to be separated out.\\xa0 Central business districts commonly include some institutions such as churches and schools, and commercial strip developments may include some residential units.\\xa0 121:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Intensive Institutional - The built-up portions of institutional land holdings, including all buildings, grounds and parking lots that compose educational, religious, health, correctional and military facilities.\\xa0 Institutions occupying small areas (for example, many churches and some elementary and secondary schools) may be included in other categories, principally residential or commercial.125:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Extensive Institutional - Public or private land holdings devoted to educational, religious, health, correctional, or military landuse. This category is one of only two that is used exclusively for landuse classifications, the other being Park Lands (Code 175).\\xa0 As the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for Atlanta, ARC is required to produce long range population and employment forecasts which are used in transportation modeling.\\xa0 The landuse categories of Extensive Institutional and Park Lands are important to ARC's long range forecasts since large tracts of land controlled by governments and institutions are more likely to be withheld from residential, commercial, or industrial development.\\xa0 Unlike Intensive Institutional (Code 121) which is visible on, and delineated from, the digital aerial photography, Extensive Institutional can only be identified and mapped from collateral data sources.\\xa0 The primary source of this information comes from the GIS Coordinators for each of the 13 counties and the City of Atlanta who reviewed the previous designations and provided updated information and additional GIS or CAD data. Various secondary sources include hardcopy, digital and internet maps and files.\\xa0 Please note, the built-up landcover portion of these various tracts of land are generally identified as Intensive Institutional (Code 121).\\xa0 The Extensive Institutional landuse areas identify the full extent of these tracts which are both built-up and non-built-up, and whose undeveloped area is at least 25 acres in size.13:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Industrial - Land associated with light or heavy manufacturing.\\xa0 Light industries, those focused on design, assembly, finishing, processing and packaging of products, can be difficult to identify using aerial photography.\\xa0 Heavy industries, those focused on the use of raw materials, such as timber and steel, are relatively uncommon in the Atlanta Region, but the category may include lumber mills and tank farms, as well as chemical, cement and brick-making plants.\\xa0 For this mapping effort, industrial landcover is more commonly captured with the Industrial and Commercial Complexes category (Code 15) which is described below.14:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Transportation, Communication and Utilities - Also referred to as &quot;TCU,&quot; this category encompasses various landuse types associated with transportation, communication, and utilities.\\xa0 Much of the automotive transportation is accounted for in other categories, particularly highways and their right-of-ways, which are either absorbed into the context of a more dominant landcover (e.g. residential or commercial), or are covered completely within the Limited Access Highways category (Code 145) described below.\\xa0 Other types of transportation include service and terminal facilities, railways (including MARTA) and their stations, parking lots, roundhouses, repair and switching yards, as well as overland track and spur connections.\\xa0 Airport facilities may include runways, terminals, service buildings, navigation aids, fuel storage, parking lots, and intervening land.\\xa0 Similar to streets and highways, communication and utility networks generally fall below the minimum mapping standards, thus are not separated out of the context of the larger landuse with which they are associated.\\xa0 When practical, areas involved in the processing, treatment and transportation of water, gas, oil, and electricity, such as pumping stations and electric substations have been delineated.\\xa0 Likewise, areas used for airwave communications, such as radio, radar, or television may be mapped in this category. 145:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Limited Access Highways - This category identifies all highways, or portions of highways that are considered\\xa0 &quot;limited access,&quot; their approximate right-of-ways, ramps and interchanges.\\xa0 In addition to the 8 interstate highways in the Region (I-20, I-75, I-85, I-285, I-575, I-595, I-675, and I-985), this category includes the entire extents of the Stone Mountain Freeway, Ronald Reagan Parkway, Freedom Parkway, Arthur Langford Parkway, the Canton Road Connector, and Spur 14 connecting the South Fulton Parkway to I-285.\\xa0 Likewise, portions of the Camp Creek Parkway, Appalachian Highway, Peachtree Industrial Boulevard, and Georgia Highway 316 are also included.\\xa0 Finally, cartographic license was taken with Georgia Highway 400 to extend this designation northward through Forsyth County, slightly beyond where interchanges stop and intersections begin, thus ceasing to actually be limited access highway.15:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Industrial and Commercial Complexes - Industrial and commercial areas that typically occur together or in close functional proximity with one another.\\xa0 For this mapping effort, based primarily on the interpretation of aerial photography, industrial areas are more commonly grouped in this category than in the Industrial (Code 13) category.\\xa0 In as much as various functions, such as warehousing, wholesaling and occasionally retailing may be found in the same structures or adjacent structures, this more inclusive category has been used to combine commercial with industrial.\\xa0 Industrial parks are almost always classified in this category.17:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Other Urban - Open land in intensive or indeterminate urban uses that do not require or do not have structures.\\xa0 Examples include water control structures and spillways, waste dumps, landfills, golf driving ranges and other recreation areas not identified as parks.\\xa0 This category excludes golf courses, cemeteries and active parks, which are contained in separate categories.171:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Golf Courses - The &quot;green space&quot; areas of golf courses, including tees, fairways, greens and intervening land.\\xa0 Forest areas and ponds are often included, but may also be identified separately (Code 40 and 53, respectively) depending on their size.\\xa0 Likewise, other built-up facilities, such as parking lots, clubhouses, pools, courts, etc. may be classified as commercial/services (Code 12).172:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Cemeteries - Public and private lands devoted to burial grounds, including primary and secondary buildings and associated infrastructure.\\xa0 Because of their unique photo &quot;signature,&quot; many small cemeteries can be identified from the digital imagery at a scale of 1:14,000; many others, however, may be combined with residential, commercial, forest, or agriculture landcover.\\xa0 Forest areas and ponds are often included in this category, but may also be identified separately (Code 40 and 53, respectively) depending on their size.173:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Parks - Active recreation areas identified from aerial photography, including baseball and other sports fields, tennis courts, swimming pools, camp grounds, parking lots, structures, drives, and trails. Forest areas and ponds are often included, but may also be identified separately (Code 40 and 53, respectively) depending on their size.175:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Park Lands - Local, state, or federal land holdings devoted to preservation, conservation or recreation, as identified from secondary sources.\\xa0 This category is one of only two that is used exclusively for landuse classifications, the other being Extensive Institutional (Code 125).\\xa0 As the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for Atlanta, ARC is required to produce long range population and employment forecasts which are used in transportation modeling.\\xa0 The landuse categories of Park Lands and Extensive Institutional are important to ARC's long range forecasts since large tracts of land controlled by governments and institutions are more likely to be withheld from residential, commercial, or industrial development.\\xa0 Unlike Parks (Code 173) which are visible on, and delineated from, the digital aerial photography, Park Lands can only be identified and mapped from collateral data sources.\\xa0 The primary source of this information comes from the GIS Coordinators for each of the 13 counties and the City of Atlanta who reviewed the previous designations and provided updated information and additional GIS or CAD data. Various secondary sources include hardcopy, digital and internet maps and files.\\xa0 Please note, the built-up landcover portion of these various tracts of land are generally identified as Parks (Code 173).\\xa0 The Park Land landuse areas identify the full extent of these tracts which are both built-up and non-built-up, and whose undeveloped area is at least 25 acres in size.21:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Agriculture-Cropland and Pasture - Agricultural land regularly used to grow field crops or to pasture animals.\\xa0 Although the 5 acre minimum mapping standard generally applies in identifying these areas and distinguishing them from Forest (Code 40) and Residential-Low Density (Code 111) landcover, for cartographic reasons it was not used in separating out forest in many larger agricultural delineations.\\xa0 Instead, these vast areas of mixed landcover were generalized with a minimum mapping unit of 25 acres.22:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Agriculture-Orchards, Vineyards and Nurseries - Agricultural land used to produce fruit, nuts or living plants for sale or for propagation.\\xa0 23:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Agriculture-Confined Feeding Operations - Agricultural land used for specialized livestock production enterprises where large animal populations are restricted to small areas.\\xa0\\xa0 Such land uses include cattle feed lots, dairy operations with little or no pasture, large poultry farms and hog feed lots.\\xa0 Shipping corrals and other temporary holding facilities are generally excluded, as are horse farms and equestrian facilities which have lower animal population densities.24:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Agriculture-Other - Agricultural land used for livestock holding, breeding and training areas, including farmsteads and associated infrastructure, such as small farm lanes, roads, ditches, canals and ponds.40:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Forest - All forested areas of coniferous and/or deciduous trees.\\xa0 Although the 5 acre minimum mapping standard generally applies with the identification of these areas in an urban context, for cartographic reasons it is not used in a rural context to separate out forest within larger agricultural delineations. Instead, these vast areas of mixed landcover are generalized with a minimum mapping unit of 25 acres.51:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Rivers - The Chattahoochee River extending from Buford Dam in Gwinnett and Forsyth counties south to Heard County.\\xa0 Other &quot;linear&quot; water bodies, such as smaller rivers, streams, creeks, and canals fall below the mapping standards used for inclusion in this category.53:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Reservoirs, Lakes, and Ponds - Man-made impoundments, often referred to as &quot;lakes&quot; or &quot;ponds,&quot; which are persistently covered with water.\\xa0 Please note, as there are no known naturally occurring lakes in the Region, the previous class called Lakes (Code 52) has been dropped from the classification system.\\xa0 For larger reservoirs, the water control structures themselves are often classified in Other Urban (Code 17).60:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Wetlands - Forested and/or herbaceous areas where the water table is at, near or above the land surface for a significant part of the growing season in most years.\\xa0 Please note, the expanse of wetlands has been greatly increased with this update over previous versions due to the availability of digital National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) data and color infrared (CIR) imagery.\\xa0 Wetland polygons were delineated at a scale of 1:6,000 using the CIR imagery after all other landcover delineations had been made at 1:14,000, mostly with the true color imagery.\\xa0 The NWI data was used as the primary &quot;backcoverage&quot; in ARC/Info for reference to wetland boundary and classification information.\\xa0 This information was concurrently compared to USGS digital raster graph (DRGs) topographic images which were viewed at the same scale in ArcView for reference to contours, hydrography, and other topographic information.\\xa0 ARC's landcover delineations represent the synthesis of these two older data sources against the 1999 CIR digital imagery using the minimum mapping standards established for the project.74:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Bare Exposed Rock - Naturally occurring areas of exposed bedrock with little or no vegetative cover.75:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Quarries, Gravel Pits, and Strip Mines - Land which is currently, or was in the past, used to extract rocks and minerals, and has had its vegetation cover removed and not replaced.\\xa0 Pits which have been flooded with water are often included in this category, but may also be identified separately as artificial impoundments (Code 53) depending on their size.76:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Transitional Areas - Recently cleared or altered land in transition from one landuse activity, either built-up or non-built-up, to another unknown or undeterminable landuse.Source: Atlanta Regional CommissionDate: 2003For additional information, please visit the Atlanta Regional Commission at www.atlantaregional.com\",\n",

The upgrades and distribution of Automated Weather Observing Systems (AWOS) Automated Surface Observation Systems (ASOS), and Automated Terminal Information Services (ATIS) in California are a critical part of the State aviation system. Access to localized weather conditions benefit both commercial and General Aviation (GA) operations. Caltrans Division of Aeronautics (Division) is monitoring the expansion and updating of the system with a focus on bringing more of this technology to key airports thereby improving air safety. Also, as AWOS/ASOS technology improves, the use of the hardware for shared uses, such as monitoring remote highways concurrently with remote airports is seen as an essential safety measure for normal as well as emergency response operations. The State is currently researching a cooperative approach to improving the road and aviation automated weather reporting system to support multimodal safety statewide.

A national digital geologic map database is essential in interpreting other datasets that support numerous types of national-scale studies and assessments, such as those that provide geochemistry, remote sensing, or geophysical data.\\xa0The SGMC is a compilation of the individual USGS releases of the Preliminary Integrated Geologic Map Databases for the U.S. It also contains updated data for seven states and seven entirely new state geologic maps that have been added since the preliminary databases were published. Numerous errors have been corrected and enhancements added to the preliminary datasets using thorough quality assurance/quality control procedures.

Therefore, any measure reported by ACS should not be taken as an exact number – this is why a corresponding margin of error (MOE) is also given for ACS measures.\\xa0The size of the MOE relative to its corresponding estimate value provides an indication of confidence in the accuracy of each estimate. Each MOE is expressed in the same units as its corresponding measure; for example, if the estimate value is expressed as a number, then its MOE will also be a number; if the estimate value is expressed as a percent, then its MOE will also be a percent.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The user should also note that for relatively small geographic areas, such as census tracts shown here, ACS only releases combined 5-year estimates, meaning these estimates represent rolling averages of survey results that were collected over a 5-year span (in this case 2013-2017). Therefore, these data do not represent any one specific point in time or even one specific year. For geographic areas with larger populations, 3-year and 1-year estimates are also available.\\xa0For further explanation of ACS estimates and margin of error, visit\\xa0Census ACS website.\\xa0Naming conventions:\\xa0Prefixes:NoneCountpPercentrRatemMedianaMean (average)tAggregate (total)chChange in absolute terms (value in t2\\xa0- value in t1)pchPercent change ((value in t2\\xa0- value in t1) / value in t1)chpChange in percent (percent in t2\\xa0- percent in t1)Suffixes:NoneChange over two periods_eEstimate from most recent ACS_mMargin of Error from most recent ACS_00Decennial 2000\\xa0\\xa0Attributes:SumLevelSummary level of geographic unit (e.g., County, Tract, NSA, NPU, DSNI, SuperDistrict, etc)GEOIDCensus tract Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) code\\xa0NAMEName of geographic unitPlanning_RegionPlanning region designation for ARC purposesAcresTotal area within the tract (in acres)SqMiTotal area within the tract (in square miles)CountyCounty identifier (combination of Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) codes for state and county)CountyNameCounty NamePop5P_e# Population 5 years and over, 2017Pop5P_m# Population 5 years and over, 2017 (MOE)EnglishOnly_e# Speaks English only, 2017EnglishOnly_m# Speaks English only, 2017 (MOE)pEnglishOnly_e% Speaks English only, 2017pEnglishOnly_m% Speaks English only, 2017 (MOE)NotEnglish_e# Speaks language other than English at home, 2017NotEnglish_m# Speaks language other than English at home, 2017 (MOE)pNotEnglish_e% Speaks language other than English at home, 2017pNotEnglish_m% Speaks language other than English at home, 2017 (MOE)EngLtVeryWell_e# English not spoken at home, speaks English less than 'very well', 2017EngLtVeryWell_m# English not spoken at home, speaks English less than 'very well', 2017 (MOE)pEngLtVeryWell_e% English not spoken at home, speaks English less than 'very well', 2017pEngLtVeryWell_m% English not spoken at home, speaks English less than 'very well', 2017 (MOE)Spanish_e# Speaks Spanish at home, 2017Spanish_m# Speaks Spanish at home, 2017 (MOE)pSpanish_e% Speaks Spanish at home, 2017pSpanish_m% Speaks Spanish at home, 2017 (MOE)SpanishEngLtVeryWell_e# Speaks Spanish at home, speaks English less than 'very well', 2017SpanishEngLtVeryWell_m# Speaks Spanish at home, speaks English less than 'very well', 2017 (MOE)pSpanishEngLtVeryWell_e% Speaks Spanish at home, speaks English less than 'very well', 2017pSpanishEngLtVeryWell_m% Speaks Spanish at home, speaks English less than 'very well', 2017 (MOE)IndoEurNotEnglish_e# Speaks other Indo-European language at home, 2017IndoEurNotEnglish_m# Speaks other Indo-European language at home, 2017 (MOE)pIndoEurNotEnglish_e% Speaks other Indo-European language at home, 2017pIndoEurNotEnglish_m% Speaks other Indo-European language at home, 2017 (MOE)IndoEurEngLtVeryWell_e# Speaks other Indo-European language at home, speaks English less than 'very well', 2017IndoEurEngLtVeryWell_m# Speaks other Indo-European language at home, speaks English less than 'very well', 2017 (MOE)pIndoEurEngLtVeryWell_e% Speaks other Indo-European language at home, speaks English less than 'very well', 2017pIndoEurEngLtVeryWell_m% Speaks other Indo-European language at home, speaks English less than 'very well', 2017 (MOE)AsianNotEnglish_e# Speaks Asian language at home, 2017AsianNotEnglish_m# Speaks Asian language at home, 2017 (MOE)pAsianNotEnglish_e% Speaks Asian language at home, 2017pAsianNotEnglish_m% Speaks Asian language at home, 2017 (MOE)AsianEngLtVeryWell_e# Speaks Asian language at home, speaks English less than 'very well', 2017AsianEngLtVeryWell_m# Speaks Asian language at home, speaks English less than 'very well', 2017 (MOE)pAsianEngLtVeryWell_e% Speaks Asian language at home, speaks English less than 'very well', 2017pAsianEngLtVeryWell_m% Speaks Asian language at home, speaks English less than 'very well', 2017\\xa0 \\xa0(MOE)OthLangNotEnglish_e# Speaks other language at home, 2017OthLangNotEnglish_m# Speaks other language at home, 2017 (MOE)pOthLangNotEnglish_e% Speaks other language at home, 2017pOthLangNotEnglish_m% Speaks other language at home, 2017 (MOE)OthLangEngLtVeryWell_e# Speaks other language at home, speaks English less than 'very well', 2017OthLangEngLtVeryWell_m# Speaks other language at home, speaks English less than 'very well', 2017 (MOE)pOthLangEngLtVeryWell_e% Speaks other language at home, speaks English less than 'very well', 2017pOthLangEngLtVeryWell_m% Speaks other language at home, speaks English less than 'very well', 2017\\xa0 \\xa0(MOE)last_edited_dateLast date the feature was edited by ARC\\xa0Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Atlanta Regional CommissionDate: 2013-2017\\xa0For additional information, please visit the\\xa0Census ACS website.\\xa0\",\n",

The user must have a firm understanding of how the datasets were compiled and the resulting limitations of these data. The National Land Cover Dataset was compiled from Landsat satellite TM imagery (circa 1992) with a spatial resolution of 30 meters and supplemented by various ancillary data (where available). The analysis and interpretation of the satellite imagery was conducted using very large, sometimes multi-state image mosaics (i.e. up to 18 Landsat scenes). Using a relatively small number of aerial photographs for 'ground truth', the thematic interpretations were necessarily conducted from a spatially-broad perspective. Furthermore, the accuracy assessments (see below) correspond to 'federal regions' which are groupings of contiguous states. Thus, the reliability of the data is greatest at the state or multi-state level. The statistical accuracy of the data is known only for the region. Important Caution Advisory With this in mind, users are cautioned to carefully scrutinize the data to see if they are of sufficient reliability before attempting to use the dataset for larger-scale or local analyses. This evaluation must be made remembering that the NLCD represents conditions in the early 1990s. The Colorado portion of the NLCD was created as part of land cover mapping activities encompassing Federal Region VIII which includes the States of Montana, North and South Dakota, Wyoming, Utah and Colorado. The NLCD classification contains 21 different land cover categories with a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The NLCD was produced as a cooperative effort between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) to produce a consistent, land cover data layer for the conterminous U.S. using early 1990s Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data purchased by the Multi-resolution Land Characterization (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies that produce or use land cover data. Partners include the USGS (National Mapping, Biological Resources, and Water Resources Divisions), US EPA, the U.S. Forest Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The USGS NLCD dataset is originally a raster GRID. For conversion to polygons it was filtered with a 5x5 majority filter. This removes the speckle pattern and creates cleaner polygons. \",\n",

       "  'dc_description_s': 'The Office of the Assessor maintains assessment records of real and personal property in the County of Los Angeles. Many of these records are available for sale. The data is available in the form of CD-ROM, DVD, hardcopy, and on-line access. The Office of the Assessor also offers a GIS Tax Parcel Base Map.Some layers included (not an exhaustive list):parcel boundary map (shapefile format)local rollLA County wall mappublicly owned parcelssales listunsecured rolland labels (for mailings)A discussion of parcel accuracyOccasionally questions about the spatial accuracy of parcel information come up. In general, it is important to note that the parcels are for tax assessment purposes only, come from many sources, some historical, and are not necessarily survey grade. That said, they are in general extremely reliable.Here is a longer description from Emilio Solano, head of the Assessor Mapping and GIS Services:The very short answer is this: our data is in its majority accurate within a couple of feet, in other cases will not be so accurate.The issue of accuracy when applied to assessor’s data is very subjective. Our data is very accurate if we consider that all the information matches recorded information, we try our best to keep recent data as it was recorded, and older data gets slightly adjusted to match the most recent data. Another factor to consider is that about one third of the total number of new parcels created every year comes from deeds, not subdivision maps, that is, there is not, in the majority of the cases, any new survey data, more likely general descriptions of where the new boundaries should exist, or references to adjacent properties, even calls to documents recorded many years ago, referring to them just by the document number. In those cases we have to consider the intent of the owner when describing the property in the deed.Another couple of factors that have an impact in the accuracy of our data comes from the fact that we assembled this vast amount of information with digital data provided from at least a dozen of cities, Los Angeles, Long Beach, Torrance, etc. plus all the data gathered by LACO DPW in CAD format. We had to compile all that data, rectify it and adjusted as needed, always keeping in mind that the integrity of the data should be maintained by matching RECORDED information. Another factor is that the data was also coming from tens of thousands of individual recordings, it wasn’t as clean cut as when you look at a single subdivision, no matter how big, where every line is clearly identified by a bearing and a distance within a perfectly traced boundary. Our original data sources even go back as far as remainder pieces of land described by Spanish grants and ranchos, section land plus newer surveys.Even though we always input our data based on survey records using COGO tools, whenever possible, a lot of the data is not. Considering all that, our GIS layer is by far, the most accurate data set of its size available anywhere in the county, both in positional accuracy, and conformity to the information provided by legal sources.All that being said, the resulting fact is that, as mark mentioned, in some areas our data will be very accurate, in others it won’t. The most important thing to keep in mind is that given that our responsibility is to reflect property information as recorded, we do not use anything else as a guide, for example we never use an aerial image to change the position of a line just because it doesn’t fall on top of a fence shown on a photo; remember that many people build their fenced, especially the ones made out of concrete blocks, a couple of inches inside the property boundary because is difficult to dig a trench along an existing wooden or wire fence, now multiply those little variances spread out over a 4000+ square miles of land and you will get a picture of what we are up to.That’s why we continually try to stress in anybody using our data that, if they need total accuracy they will need to hire a surveyor to get it. Our 11 by 17 maps are our only official source of information and should only be used for assessment purposes, or in the case of other uses, just for information, to get an accurate idea of how close to the real location a line could be.',\n",

Starting in 1812 land was divided into square six mile blocks called townships, then subdivided into sections and ranges. Each subdivided area was surveyed and given its own map or GLO. During this process surveyors were required to indicate cultural resources such as roads and Indian trails and standardized symbols were used to represent geographic features. These GLOs are now maintained by the Bureau of Land Management as part of the official Land Status and Cadastral Survey records. As land was divided into parcels of individual ownership additional cadastral survey maps were created over time. For this reason there are often multiple GLOs or &quot;cadastral survey maps&quot; for one township / range, generally numbered one through four. For this seamless GLO layer, DAHP focused solely on the more historical GLOs which were usually listed as image number one or two for that specific township / range in the BLM Cadastral Survey records. In some cases no GLOs were available for review. Such areas included National Forest Lands, National Parks, Indian Reservations, and remote wilderness areas.',\n",

Biodiesel fuel can be used in diesel engines without changing the engine. Pure biodiesel is non-toxic, biodegradable and produces lower levels of most air pollutants than petroleum-based diesel fuel. Biodiesel is usually sold as a blend of biodiesel and petroleum-based diesel fuel. A common blend of diesel fuel is B20, which is 20% biodiesel.Biodiesel PlantsData Currency: May 1, 2015To learn more:\\xa0Biofuels: Ethanol and Biodiesel ExplainedTo access the source data:\\xa0Layer Information for Interactive State MapsFor feedback:\\xa0ArcGIScomNationalMaps@esri.comThumbnail image courtesy of:\\xa0United Soybean BoardOther Federal User Community federally focused content that may interest you\\xa0U.S. Department of Energy\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Energy Information Administration\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: USDOE\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: EIA',\n",

MODIS Global Fires is a product of NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS), part of NASA's Earth Science Data. EOSDIS integrates remote sensing and GIS technologies to deliver global MODIS hotspot/fire locations to natural resource managers and other stakeholders around the World.Source:NASA FIRMS - Active Fire Data - for WorldScale/Resolution:1kmUpdate Frequency:1/2 Hour (every 30 minutes) using the Aggregated Live Feed MethodologyArea Covered:WorldWhat can I do with this layer?The MODIS thermal activity layer can be used to visualize and assess wildfires worldwide. However, it should be noted that this dataset contains many “false positive” (e.g., oil/natural gas wells or volcanoes) since the satellite will detect any large thermal signal.Additional Information:MODIS stands for MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. The MODIS instrument is on board NASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites. The orbit of the Terra satellite goes from north to south across the equator in the morning and Aqua passes south to north over the equator in the afternoon resulting in global coverage every 1 to 2 days. The EOS satellites have a ±55 degree scanning pattern and orbit at 705 km with a 2,330 km swath width.It takes approximately 2 – 4 hours after satellite overpass for MODIS Rapid Response to process the data, and for the Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) to update the website. Occasionally, hardware errors mean that it takes longer than the 2-4 hours to process the data. Additional information on the MODIS system status can be found at MODIS Rapid Response.Attribute Information:Latitude and Longitude: The center point location of the 1km (approx.) pixel flagged as containing one or more fires/hotspots (fire size is not 1km, but variable). See What does a hotspot/fire detection mean on the ground?Brightness: The brightness temperature measured (in Kelvin) using the MODIS channels 21/22 and channel 31.Scan and Track: The actual spatial resolution of the scanned pixel. Although the algorithm works at 1km resolution, the MODIS pixels get bigger toward the edge of the scan. See What does scan and track mean?Date: Acquisition date of the hotspot/active fire pixel.Time: Time of the overpass of the satellite (in UTC).Satellite: Whether the detection was picked up by the Terra or Aqua satellite.Confidence: The detection confidence is a quality flag of the individual hotspot/active fire pixel.Version: Version refers to the processing collection and source of data. The number before the decimal refers to the collection (e.g. MODIS Collection 6). The number after the decimal indicates the source of Level 1B data; data processed in near-real time by MODIS Rapid Response will have the source code “CollectionNumber.0”. Data sourced from MODAPS (with a 2-month lag) and processed by FIRMS using the standard MOD14/MYD14 Thermal Anomalies algorithm will have a source code “CollectionNumber.x”. For example, data with the version listed as 5.0 is collection 5, processed by MRR, data with the version listed as 5.1 is collection 5 data processed by FIRMS using Level 1B data from MODAPS.Bright.T31: Channel 31 brightness temperature (in Kelvins) of the hotspot/active fire pixel.FRP: Fire Radiative Power. Depicts the pixel-integrated fire radiative power in MW (MegaWatts). FRP provides information on the measured radiant heat output of detected fires. The amount of radiant heat energy liberated per unit time (the Fire Radiative Power) is thought to be related to the rate at which fuel is being consumed (Wooster et. al. (2005)).This map is provided for informational purposes and is not monitored 24/7 for accuracy and currency.\",\n",

       "  'dc_description_s': '[1.0] Project OverviewThe Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) contracted Aerial Information Systems, Inc. (AIS) to perform a 2015 Land Use Update (aka Phase 1, Product 1, P1) and to create a 2015 Enhanced Land Use Update (aka Phase 2, Product 2, P2) data set for the nine-county DVRPC region consisting of Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia counties in Pennsylvania, and Camden, Burlington, Gloucester, and Mercer counties in New Jersey. The project started in February 2016 and completed in April 2017. AIS used computer interactive photo interpretation and heads-up digitizing to create both land use datasets. The project was performed in two phases.This metadata is for the Enhanced Land Use (P2) mapping effort.The P2 layer was the creation of an enhanced land use layer using a more detailed land use classification and standardized data capture criteria, including minimum mapping size guidelines for built-up land use types and parking lots. The P2 layer will support DVRPC’s more detailed planning analyses goals and other programs and projects at DVRPC and their member governments and agencies.Despite some overlap in the land use classification and data capture criteria for each effort, the P1 and P2 geodatabases do not completely correlate to one another due to the more detailed P2 classification, changes in the categorization of some land use features from P1 to P2 and revisions to the original DVRPC data capture criteria.All work was performed by AIS staff, at the AIS office in Redlands, California using Esri ArcGIS 10.3 software capabilities. No sub-contractors or outside consultants were used throughout the performance of the contract.[2.0] Enhanced Land Use Update (P2)[2.1] Adjust Parcels to County BoundariesThe first task of the Enhanced Land Use Update was to adjust the individual county parcel datasets to the DVRPC regional county boundary file to ensure there were no gaps or overlaps in the parcel data along county boundaries. Parcel boundaries along the county edge were extended and/or “clipped” to the regional county boundaries, thereby removing gaps and/or overlaps in the parcel data. The parcel boundaries were not otherwise adjusted.[2.2] Fast-Track MappingUpon completion of the P1 mapping effort, a fast-track mapping effort was performed in Camden County, NJ to test the data capture criteria and assumptions developed for the P2 Enhanced mapping. Issues identified during this process were discussed and resolved in consultation with DVRPC through a series of conference call “webinars”. The process helped to resolve major criteria issues at an early stage of the project, thereby facilitating the consistent data capture and uninterrupted workflow of the P2 production mapping.[2.3] Enhanced Land Use Data Creation (P2)The 2015 P1 Land Use Update and the 2015 DVRPC imagery were used as the baseline for the Enhanced Land Use interpretations, using the same working production module grid developed for the P1 mapping process. The same computer interactive heads-up digitizing techniques used to capture the P1 data were used for the P2 mapping but the information was captured per the more detailed land use categories described in attached documentation and the P2 criteria described in this document.The interpreters reviewed the newly created 2015 P1 land use layer against the 2015 digital imagery and revised the data to 2015 conditions following the more detailed P2 land use classification and minimum mapping unit guidelines. Polygon boundaries and/or attributes were modified accordingly, regardless of whether it was a subdivision of the P1 data to reflect the more detailed classification and mapping criteria, or a revision to correct legacy coding/boundary errors retained in the data from previous land use inventories.The Enhanced Land Use delineations and codes were edgematched to adjacent production modules and across county boundaries, as applicable, to ensure the continuity of information across boundaries.[3.0] Quality Control ReviewTo ensure the accuracy and completeness of the interpretations for both the 2015 Land Use (P1) Update and the Enhanced Land Use (P2), a comprehensive quality control (QC) review was performed to ensure the land use delineations and codes adhered to the project criteria and classification for both the P1 and P2 mapping efforts.Senior AIS staff members reviewed the updated and enhanced land use features to verify the accuracy and consistency among interpreters, looking for completeness, uncoded polygons, unnecessary boundaries, and how well the delineations match the imagery. The edgematch to adjoining completed modules was also reviewed and any discrepancies along the edges were resolved. In addition, automated final checks for topology errors and invalid codes were also conducted once the production modules were joined together. One last quality control review was conducted on the completed geodatabases prior to the draft and final deliveries to ensure that the database was seamless and was processed correctly.[4.0] Map ValidationIn addition to the Quality Control task, a series of map validation procedures were performed to ensure the accuracy of the 2015 Land Use data and the Enhanced Land Use mapping per the P1 and P2 project classifications and mapping criteria. The validation process consisted of on-line virtual field surveys using internet resources such as Google Maps, Bing Maps, Google Earth, and other websites; review of multiple image sets representing different eras; correlation to county parcel data; and DVRPC staff comments arising from AIS questions and the DVRPC review of the data.[4.1] Ancillary Digital ImageryIn addition to the 2015 base imagery, the interpreters referred to the 2010 natural color digital ortho-rectified imagery provided by DVRPC and online imagery available through Google Maps, Google Earth and Bing Maps. The ancillary imagery provided the interpreters with a more comprehensive picture of the land use by providing them with views of the study area under different seasonal conditions, in different eras. The interpreters used this information to make more accurate informed decisions about the pattern of land use and types of land use change for a given area.[4.2] Virtual Field Checks (Internet Resources)The internet proved to be a significant resource of information for the 2015 Update and was used to perform “virtual” field checks for both the P1 and P2 land use interpretations. The amount and quality of online information obtained by this virtual field survey method was particularly valuable for the more detailed P2 mapping effort due to the level of classification detail and the ¼-acre minimum mapping unit for built-up land use types. The Google Maps and Bing Maps Street View images, where available, often allowed the interpreter to read building signs and other information, to help identify the land use type. Google Maps was also an excellent resource for built-up (urban) land use types as it provided the names and point locations of private and public entities, often with additional links to associated websites.Google Earth provided the same advantages that Google Maps did, but in addition, it also had multiple sets of imagery spanning different timeframes, which enabled the interpreter to get a historical perspective of an area. The imagery from multiple eras was advantageous when historical knowledge of an area helped make coding decisions. This was primarily useful when evaluating change in transitional areas, particularly when trying to determine the status of agricultural land.Bing Maps was primarily used by the interpreters for the Bird’s Eye and Street View images, where available. The Bird’s Eye imagery provided the interpreters with a close-up view of the area in question, sometimes at multiple oblique angles, in order to see more clearly areas of change, determine property boundaries, and even the relative height of vegetation when these features were not clearly visible on the project imagery. Bing Maps also provided land use information but not to the same degree as Google Maps.The Google search engine was frequently used by interpreters to further research the information obtained from Google Maps and Bing Maps, in order to more accurately classify the land use type.[4.3] Digital County Parcel DataThe county parcel data provided varying levels of land use information depending on the level of parcel land use detail and how closely the parcel land use classes matched the P1 and P2 land use class descriptions. The interpreters used the information to corroborate the land use attributes for the P1 and P2 data, accordingly.[4.4] Digital USGS Raster DataOpen source USGS raster data (DRGs) was another resource used to increase the accuracy of the interpretations. Due to the age of the DRG information, they were used primarily to verify the general topography and to get a historic perspective of the vegetation and land use for a given area.[4.5] DVRPC Interactive Teleconference, Data Review and CommentAdditional validation steps of the land use assignment were performed through consultation with DVRPC staff over the course of the project, particularly for the P2 mapping effort. AIS created bookmarks in the data identifying issues requiring further discussion and resolution with DVRPC staff. These issues were reviewed during a series of teleconference webinars using the JoinMe computer program that allowed for the sharing of computer screens in real time. This process was immensely helpful in furthering the development of the mapping criteria and classification descriptions for the P2 mapping effort. The issues/questions were documented and the meeting notes delivered to DVRPC for their internal documentation. In some instances, the resolution coming from DVRPC resulted in global changes to the criteria. In other situations, the issues were localized, only affecting a limited number of features. In both examples, the input from DVRPC increased the accuracy and provided validation of the land use types in question.[5.0] DVRPC ReviewUpon completion of the mapping for each county, the draft datasets were submitted to DVRPC for their review and acceptance, for both the P1 and P2 mapping efforts. The DVPRC review comments, if any, were re-delivered to AIS for revision, and if necessary, further comment. Upon completion of this process, the final data set was delivered to DVRPC.[6.0] General Representation of Land Use Features[6.1] When a road separated differing land use features, the polygons for these features followed the perceived road centerline. Although roads often include a right-of-way on either side, these slivers of land between the roads and the adjacent land use features were aggregated with the land use unless they could be reasonably extracted. The above criteria were applied for the delineation of new land use polygons. Existing land use polygon boundaries that fell within the road right-of-way but did not follow road centerlines due to image registration issues were not corrected.[6.2] Where roads and features on the orthophoto differed from those represented on other collateral sources, the location on the orthophoto was used to depict the feature.[6.3] Boundaries were followed as closely as possible. Where boundaries were particularly jagged, however, some cartographic smoothing was deemed appropriate. This was generally for use along natural boundaries and was rarely needed along “man-made” boundaries.[6.4] Built-up land uses usually follow “man-made” features such as fence lines, roads, and property boundaries. Boundaries were typically drawn with straight lines and right angle corners were used; lines were placed down the centerline of boundaries (such as roads and tree lines).[6.5] Buildings housing different land use types were typically not split. Where different land use types are connected to one another (share a common wall), the building was typically delineated as a single feature and assigned the appropriate land use type. Covered walkways that connected buildings also allowed the buildings to be captured as a single feature (examples include Regional &amp; Community Retail Centers). Where there were gaps between buildings (they do not share a common wall), the buildings were assessed individually. This criterion applied to all land use types. Exceptions are noted in the classification description.[6.6] Commercial Shopping Developments (P2 only) code assignments were based on the building configuration, not the general development of the area. For example, where both stand-alone and connected buildings are on a single property, they will be captured independently of one another, assuming each meets the project minimum mapping unit of ¼ acre.[6.7] Abandoned built-up land use will be coded as the last known use if the buildings appear in reasonably good order. If the buildings have been demolished, or have deteriorated to the point where they cannot be used “as is” (i.e. they should be demolished), the feature will be coded as Undeveloped (14000).[6.8] Natural vegetation boundaries tend to be transitional therefore the line separating different classes was often less distinct. These polygons seldom contained straight edges or angles unless the vegetation unit was adjacent to built-up or “man-made” features. Vegetation category polygons were usually represented with flowing and curvilinear lines, reflecting the more natural shape of the land cover.[7.0] Minimum Mapping Units (MMU)[7.1] Quarter-acre (¼ acre) = built-up land use, Agriculture, Water, and Undeveloped in urban areas.[7.2] Two (2) acre = Single Family Residential in non-urban areas, Undeveloped in non-urban areas, and Wooded.[7.3] Sixty foot (60’) minimum width for water and other linear features excluding Highway ROW and Rail ROW.[7.4] Highway ROW = Divided highway (as shown on Google Maps) and where they are One-hundred feet (100’) wide. Existing ROW that do not meet this criteria are grandfathered in.[7.5] Rail ROW = Three (3) Rail lines within ROW. Existing ROW that do not meet this criteria are grandfathered in.[7.6] No minimum size for “remnant” built-up land uses. Remnant land uses are below resolution features created by the subdivision of their original boundaries due to land use, criteria changes, or street casing splits.[7.7] Parking lots with ten (10) parking spaces or more.[8.0] Below-MMU polygons[8.1] Below resolution polygons were left intact or created in the following situations: Below resolution land use features were mapped provided they were significant to the overall classification of the area. Typically, this occurred where the land use type was present within a given area but no single feature attained the minimum mapping size. If the MMU had been strictly observed, these units would not have been captured in the database. By mapping certain land use classes smaller than the MMU, the user is given a more accurate depiction of land use conditions in these areas.[8.2] Remnant polygons from the 2010 Update were kept in the data as long as they were significant to the overall classification of the area. Typically, these included built-up land uses and wetland vegetation types. Upland vegetation remnants were usually re-classified into surrounding land use polygons.[9.0] Land Use AggregationWhere a non-exempted class did not meet the minimum mapping unit size, it was aggregated into an adjacent land use type per the following general guidelines:[9.1] Built-up land uses took precedence over non built-up categories. For example, if a below-MMU residential land use was adjacent to a below-MMU forest cover, the forested area was typically absorbed into the residential land use.[9.2] In general, residential land uses took precedence over other built-up land uses. If a below-MMU residential land use was adjacent to a below-MMU commercial land use, typically the commercial area was absorbed into the residential land use.[9.3] If a below-MMU land use feature was surrounded by a number of other above-MMU land use features, then the below-MMU unit would be absorbed into the unit that most closely represented its class. For example, if a below-MMU residential class was next to above-MMU commercial, industrial, and forested polygons, the residential land use was absorbed into the commercial polygon.[9.4] An isolated below-MMU land use feature completely surrounded by a single land use feature was absorbed into the surrounding land use class.[9.5] Some remnant polygons remaining from the 2010 Update were merged according to the criteria above if they were not significant to the overall classification of the area.[10.0] Order of Precedence[10.1] Roads take precedence over Railroads, Utility, and Water.[10.2] Railroads take precedence over Utility and Water.[10.3] Water takes precedence over Utility.[10.4] Transitional Land takes precedence over Utility: Right-of-Way.[10.5] Residential backyards (developed) and areas of equipment/material storage associated with industrial/commercial uses take precedence over Utility: Right-of-Way.[10.6] Utility: Right-of-Way takes precedence over Agriculture, Undeveloped, and Wooded.[10.7] Drainage Basins take precedence over Highway ROW and Utility ROW.[11.0] Parking Lot Criteria[11.1] Minimum mapping size = ten (10) parking spaces.[11.2] Includes parking areas designated for residents, visitors (shoppers), and employees.[11.3] Does not include parking for company vehicles, such as police, fire, and utility yards, bus yards, trucking companies, industrial truck parking.[11.4] Does not include undesignated or “opportunistic” parking areas such as vacant lots that function as informal parking for an area.[11.5] Parking lots can be paved or unpaved (gravel).[11.6] Unpaved lots should have some kind of parking infrastructure visible on the photos, such as light standards or other indications that the lot is used for parking. Where the infrastructure is not visible and no clearly defined parking relationship can be established with the adjacent land use, the gravel lots will be coded as vacant.[11.7] Where a single parking lot serves multiple land use types, the parking lot will be delineated based on visible boundaries, e.g. walls, landscaping, changes in pavement, roads, etc., that can be correlated to the individual land use types. Where these boundaries are not present, an arbitrary boundary will be drawn based on a “reasonable” division of the parking area and proximity to the associated land use. Where a “reasonable” division cannot be made, the parking lot will be captured as a single feature and assigned the most appropriate land use code.[11.8] Where buildings have been demolished but the associated parking lot remains, the new code, Parking: Undetermined Use (14009) will be applied.[11.9] Former parking lots that have deteriorated to the point of being not viable for parking (asphalt removed, very weedy, etc.) will be captured as Undeveloped (14000) in P2.[11.10] Parking lots for model homes are captured as Parking: Commercial/Parking: Commercial Other (06009).[11.11] Parking lots that cannot be correlated to a specific land use will be captured as Parking: Undetermined Use (14009).[11.12] The entire parking area of abandoned car lots is captured as Parking: Commercial Other (06009). This includes the new car parking areas previously coded as Commercial. The abandoned sales offices and service garages will remain Commercial, per the abandoned land use mapping criteria.[11.13] Parking lots owned/operated by government (municipal, county, state) parking authorities are captured as Parking: Institutional Other (07009), if the lots are not clearly associated with other non-institutional use; ownership will direct the code attribution. If the lots are linked to non-institutional land uses, the parking will be captured for the use; the use will take precedence over ownership.[11.14] Freestanding garages in multi-family residential developments are captured as Parking: Residential Multi-Family (01019), not as Residential: Multi-Family.[11.15] Multi-story parking structures where the ground floor contains other uses are captured as Parking for the associated use, not the ground floor use.[11.16] Does not include “head-in” street parking.[11.17] Does not include temporary parking lots associated with construction sites.[11.18] A parking garage in Philadelphia has the following features: it serves both an office tower and apartments, and it has an urban park on the roof. It is best captured as Parking: Office (06059).[11.19] If landscaping is located between the parking and the street, with no buildings in between, the landscaping will be included with the parking. Where there are large areas of landscaping (one acre or more), an exception can be made, and the area captured as the associated use.[11.20] If the landscaping is located between the building and the street, the landscaping will be included with the use.[11.21] If the landscaping is located adjacent to the street, building(s), and parking, the landscaping will typically be captured with the associated use; it will not be subdivided at the point where it is adjacent to the parking area.Fieldslu15cat: Land use main category two-digit code.lu15catn: Land use main category name.lu15catlu15catnArcGIS color01ResidentialSolar Yellow (RGB: 255 255 0)03IndustrialLilac Dust (RGB: 194 158 215)04TransportationGray 60% (RGB: 104 104 104)05UtilityRose Quartz (RGB: 255 190 190)06CommercialMars Red (RGB: 255 0 0)07InstitutionalSodalite Blue (RGB: 190 232 255)08MilitaryDelft Blue (RGB: 0 132 168)09RecreationCitroen Yellow (RGB: 230 230 0)10AgricultureLime Dust (RGB: 215 215 158)11MiningTuscan Red (RGB: 168 0 0)12WoodedQuetzel Green (RGB: 76 230 0)13WaterBig Sky Blue (RGB: 0 197 255)14UndevelopedMedium Key Lime (RGB: 165 245 122)lu15sub: Land use subcategory five-digit code.lu15subn: Land use subcategory name.lu15dev: Development status.luP1cat: Equivalent land use category codes employed during 2015 P1 land use delineation (and all previous land use work - 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010), prior to the creation of the 2015 enhanced (P2) land use categories.luP1catn: Equivalent land use categories employed during 2015 P1 land use delineation (and all previous land use work - 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010), prior to the creation of the 2015 enhanced (P2) land use categories.',\n",

The CAD file was created by digitizing the RICA Maps of Pompeii, 1984, supported by World Monuments Watch and funded by American Express. The RICA MAPs were drawn in part from aerial images taken at 820m and supplemented by on the ground survey. Inconsistencies among the features of this layer with satellite imagery or other maps of Pompeii may be the result of errors in the rectification of the original aerial images and differences projected between coordinate systems (PBMP data are in the Monte_Mario_Italy_2 projected coordinate system). On the creation of the RICA Maps, see Van der Poel, H. B., Corpus Topographicum Pompeianum, vol. IIIA. Austin, TX, 1986, XI-XIX.\\xa0Topologies: Individual features of this feature class are arranged so that their order produces best the visibility and relationships of all.

The MODIS instrument images the entire surface of the Earth every two days (daily in northern latitudes), making observations in 36 co-registered spectral bands at moderate spatial resolutions (250, 500, and 1000 meters). Thermal information is collected at 1000-meter spatial resolution. The collected thermal information is converted to ellipse-shaped vector polygons. These collections are processed through the MODLand Rapid Response System using the algorithm described by the MOD14 Users Guide. The thermal MODIS data is shown by the color of the symbol on the map. This thermal data is collected twice a day, at 2:00 PM EST and again at 12:00 AM EST and are then processed and merged into a single map, which is available by 3:00 AM EST.The currency of the thermal MODIS data is shown by the color of the symbol on the map.Map LegendThermal MODIS Map LegendIdentification of a MODIS pixel as &quot;fire&quot; in this layer does not necessarily mean that the entire area represented by the pixel is on fire. The identification of a fire can be the result of a hot fire in a relatively small area, or a cooler fire over a larger area. At this time, there is no way to discriminate between these two possibilities. The geolocation of the centroid of the fire pixel is within one-half of one pixel (500-meters) of the location shown on the map.The Thermal MODIS layer is updated every two hours. However, there may be gaps in daily coverage as explained below. If we have received no new data, the &quot;expired&quot; layers are not replaced. The layer is replaced as soon as we receive an updated file.The thermal information is collected at a 1 km spatial resolution and converted to ellipse-shaped vector polygons. The geolocation of the centroid of each polygon is within one-half of one pixel (500-meters) of the location shown on the map.

Common sources of errors are:Spatial ResolutionSatellites capture and store information in pixels (picture elements). Together, pixels create an image. The Landsat TM and ETM images have pixels that cover a square on the earth that is 30 meters on a side (~100 feet). This medium resolution is appropriate and valuable for regional analysis. It does not provide detail that is available in higher resolution images.MixedPixelsEach pixel of the land cover maps covers a 30 meter square (~100 feet) of the earth. Often, that 30 meter square is covered by one land cover class, such as trees that define forest or buildings that define developed. When a pixel covers a square that contains more then one class, it is called a mixed pixel. Every effort is taken to correctly classify the mixed pixels into the majority class, however, error can result when classifying mixed pixels.Residential Neighborhoods with Tree CoverSatellites see, or capture information, based on what is visible from above. Sometimes features on the earth can be &quot;hidden&quot; by other features. For example, houses or buildings are sometimes hidden underneath forest canopy. The land cover classification may miss houses and other structures in older neighborhoods with many large, tall trees and classify these areas as forest instead of developed. However, through the use of the rasterized roads layer, older residential developments will be identified in the land cover. Also, old and new houses may be missed if they are built in the forest with little or no clearing.',\n",

The data covers all plants with a combined nameplate capacity of 1 MW (Megawatt) or more.In 2016, most U.S. electricity was generated using fossil fuels. The largest energy source in the U.S. generating 4 trillion kilowatt hours of electricity was natural gas. Natural gas was the source of about 34% of electric generation. The second largest energy source for electricity generation was coal with 30% of all power generation. Petroleum can be burned to produce electric generation, but this source is not a large source in power generation with less than 1% of U.S. electric generation. Nuclear power provided the U.S. with 1/5th of total U.S. electricity or about 20% of all U.S. electricity generation. Renewable energy sources provided 15% of total U.S. electricity in 2016. Hydropower generated 7% of total U.S. electricity generation and about 44% of electricity generation from renewable energy. Electricity generation from wind has increased significantly in the United States since 1970. In 2016, wind power provided almost 6% of U.S. electricity generation and about 37% of electricity generation from renewable energy.Biomass is a material derived from plants or animals and includes lumber, paper mill wastes, food scraps, grass, leaves and paper. Biomass can also include forestry and agricultural residues such as wood chips, corn cobs and wheat straw. However, Biomass has only accounted for 2% of the total U.S. electricity generation in 2016. Solar power produces energy from the sun and in 2016, generated about 1% of U.S. electricity generation. Geothermal power comes from heat energy beneath the surface of the earth.

Instead, summary median wait times are reported at the level of Regional Health Authority.The median wait time is the maximum wait time experienced by half (50 per cent) of the patients who received a hip and/or knee replacement during that month. The wait time refers to the number of weeks between the 'decision to treat' date and surgery date.The data includes primary hip and/or knee replacements, but not partial hip and/or knee replacements. It includes wait times for patients who are fit and ready, but excluding emergency cases. A lower number is better, because it shows a shorter amount of time for the patient to receive surgery.NOTE: This Manitoba wait time data cannot be compared to the wait times reported for Manitoba by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI).The Manitoba data does not include wait times for patients who had their surgeries delayed because they were unavailable.

This measure is reported in hours.This data includes admitted and non-admitted patients. It does not include patients who left without being seen or left against medical advice after initial assessment. The Manitoba data includes information from all Winnipeg Regional Health Authority (WRHA) emergency department or urgent care centre sites, as well as Brandon and Selkirk emergency department data.A lower number is better, as it shows a shorter wait time for a typical emergency department/urgent care centre patient to see a provider.NOTE: This Manitoba data matches the definition used by the Canadian Institute for Health Information.The Manitoba data shows median wait time and not a 90th percentile (the wait time for nine out of 10 patients). This was to make sure it was comparable to other measures on this page.In addition, this data is different from data publicly reported by the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority.The Winnipeg Regional Health Authority uses a measure called &quot;wait to be seen&quot;. The Winnipeg data is calculated for all individuals registered in an emergency department/urgent care centre, even if they did not see a provider.The Manitoba data on this page leaves out these cases from wait times calculations and only reports wait times for patients who saw a provider.This is to ensure the data shows a wait time for someone who was assessed by a health care provider.VolumesProvince-wide volumes are available.The overall volume is the number of patients registered in an ED or UCC.This data includes admitted and non-admitted patients. It also includes patients who left without being seen or left against medical advice after initial assessment.Neither a lower nor a higher value for ED/UCC volumes is necessarily preferable. The former may indicate a lack of access to emergency/urgent care services (e.g. long wait times and higher numbers of patients who left without being seen), while the latter may suggest issues with patient flow to other service settings (e.g. utilization of emergency or urgent care services instead of primary care).Source: Emergency Department Information System (EDIS)For more information, visit:\\xa0www.manitoba.ca/healthcaresooner/waittimes/emergency.html.Cataract SurgeryMonthly reports of median wait times (weeks) and service volumes dating back to April 2008.Median Wait TimeSummary values for province-wide median wait times are not available.

Scans for people in hospital or emergency cases are not included, as these patients do not wait for scans. The wait times are measured from the time a request for a scan is received until the scan takes place. The time is measured in weeks.Wait TimeSummary values for province-wide wait times are available.MRI or CT wait times are reported differently by different sites, either as the time that any patient is expected to wait for the service or the time that patients waited for the service. The Manitoba overall wait time is a weighted average of the wait times at each facility in Manitoba that performs the service. A lower number is better, because it shows a shorter amount of time for the patient to receive a scan.NOTE: This Manitoba wait time data is different from those reported for Manitoba by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI).The data reported by CIHI only includes patients who are 18 years and older, while the Manitoba data includes all cases to represent all MRI and CT use and wait times in the province, including for children.The Manitoba data is based on monthly wait times reported as an average wait time for completed cases or an average or minimum wait time based on the next available appointment. The Manitoba wait times reported by CIHI represent median wait times over a single six-month period.VolumesProvince-wide volumes are available.The service volume is the total number of MRI or CT exams performed at Manitoba facilities during the reporting month. Patients may receive more than one exam during a session. Consequently, the number of exams performed does not represent the number of patients seen.The service volume includes inpatient, outpatient, and emergent cases. This also includes routine follow-up scans.A higher number indicates a larger number of scans are being performed at Manitoba facilities to meet growing demand.

The data covers all plants with a combined nameplate capacity of 1 MW (Megawatt) or more.In 2016, most U.S. electricity was generated using fossil fuels. The largest energy source in the U.S. generating 4 trillion kilowatt hours of electricity was natural gas. Natural gas was the source of about 34% of electric generation. The second largest energy source for electricity generation was coal with 30% of all power generation. Petroleum can be burned to produce electric generation, but this source is not a large source in power generation with less than 1% of U.S. electric generation. Nuclear power provided the U.S. with 1/5th of total U.S. electricity or about 20% of all U.S. electricity generation. Renewable energy sources provided 15% of total U.S. electricity in 2016. Hydropower generated 7% of total U.S. electricity generation and about 44% of electricity generation from renewable energy. Electricity generation from wind has increased significantly in the United States since 1970. In 2016, wind power provided almost 6% of U.S. electricity generation and about 37% of electricity generation from renewable energy.Biomass is a material derived from plants or animals and includes lumber, paper mill wastes, food scraps, grass, leaves and paper. Biomass can also include forestry and agricultural residues such as wood chips, corn cobs and wheat straw. However, Biomass has only accounted for 2% of the total U.S. electricity generation in 2016. Solar power produces energy from the sun and in 2016, generated about 1% of U.S. electricity generation. Geothermal power comes from heat energy beneath the surface of the earth. However, here again geothermal power generation was less than 1% of total U.S. electricity generation in 2016.Power PlantsData currency: June 26, 2017Data source:\\xa0MAPSFor more information, please visit:\\xa0Electricity - ExplainedFor feedback:\\xa0ArcGIScomNationalMaps@esri.comThumbnail source image courtesy of:\\xa0Jeanne MenjouletSymbology courtesy of the following\\xa0Noun Project\\xa0contributors:\\xa0Lisa Staudinger, Robert Beerwerth, Nikita Kozin, emilegraphics, Ron Scott, BomSymbols, Andrejs Kirma, Becris, Symbolon and IconathonOther Federal User Community federally focused content that may interest you\\xa0U.S. Department of Energy\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Energy Information Administration\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: USDOE\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: EIA\\xa0',\n",

Therefore, the GIS data presented herein are approximations and further land development determination is at the discretion of the PRMD planning staff which may require a parcel specific site review (to draw parcel specific conclusions). Please see Access and Use Constraints.The parcel dataset represents ONLY unincorporated Sonoma County land and takes into account all recorded annexations as of April 2017.\\xa0The parcel dataset is based on an original parcel base obtained from the County of Sonoma, ISD/GIS (a.k.a. Central GIS). Due to the sensitive nature of land development datasets maintained by Sonoma County Permit and Resource Management Department [PRMD], only those parcels which have been reassigned a parcel number [APN] or have been reconfigured due to lot line adjustments, subdivision and/or merger/splits, are updated by PRMD GIS staff. [Note: Should you wish to obtain Central GIS, a non-ActiveMap/PRMD, parcel base dataset, please research vector data download link https://gis.sonoma-county.org/catalog.asp.] A distinction should be made with respect to this layer which includes GIS parcels and the official Assessor Parcels residing in the Assessor Map books at the Sonoma County Assessor Office. For official parcel records please contact the Sonoma County Assessor (707)565-1888. These parcels should NOT be represented as survey data, and the official record of survey takes precedence where there are discrepancies. It is the end user's responsibility to check the accuracy of the GIS data by comparing it with the published data from the Sonoma County Assessor / Recorder office. The Sonoma County parcel base was originally compiled from Assessor Parcel maps at a scale of 1:6000. The individual Assessor Parcel maps were enlarged or reduced in size using an electrostatic process to produce the maps at the 1:6000 scale, the maps were then fit together by hand and transcribed on to mylar. The mylar base consisted of 1:6000 USGS base map information typically found on the 7.5 USGS quad series. This base information consisted of Topography, Roads, Section, and Rancho lines to name some. Using this information, the Assessor Parcel maps were fit to the individual 1:6000 scale maps. Each 1:6000 scale map represents 1/6 (quad sixths) of a 7.5 minute USGS Quadrangle series map. In 1998 the State Board of Equalization provided the impetus to produce the Russian River Project for all of Planning Area 4. One aspect required for this project was a digital parcel base for Planning Area 4. This involved the conversion of the 1:6000 mylars with the transcribed parcels on them into a digital version of the parcels. The mylars where scanned and geo-referenced using the base map information originally included with the 1:6000 mylar base. The maps were geo-referenced to a digital version of the USGS 7.5 minute Quadrangle series available from the Teale Data Center. The original projection was California State Plane Zone 2 NAD 1927. County Staff then used AutoCAD software to heads up digitize each 1:6000 scale map in Planning Area 4. A custom application was created and used by GIS staff involving the use of Avenue and ArcView 3.2 to create a point for all the parcels in Planning Area 4, attributes included Assessor Parcel Number. The DWGs were then converted to shapefiles and then converted to ArcINFO coverages, the parcel tags were converted from shapefiles to ArcINFO coverages and the point coverage was merged with the polygon coverage with the IDENTITY command. An exhaustive process was involved to eliminate errors once the DWGs were converted to ArcINFO coverages so polygons could be generated. The coverages were then aggregated using the MAPJOIN command, the original boundary of the 1:6000 scale maps was removed using the REGIONDISSOLVE command to merge adjacent polygons with the same AP number. In 1999 the remainder of the planning areas were converted to digital form following the Russian River Project and the seamless base was completed in 2001. The seamless parcel base was maintained in ArcINFO until the release of ArcGIS 8.3, which included topology tools necessary for its maintenance. The seamless base prior to late 2002 was suitable for 1:100000 scale while the control points (the corners for the 1:6000 scale maps) were suitable for 1:24000 scale. Prior to rectification to the Merrick 2000 orthophotography, the parcel data were derived from 1:6000 scale maps (enlarged from USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle 1:24,000 series) and digitized in California State Plane, Zone II, NAD 27 coordinates (survey feet), but were converted to California State Plane, Zone II, NAD 83 coordinates (survey feet) as part of a rectification process now underway. The parcels used to use the USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle (1:24,000) series for coordinate control, but no guarantee is made for their spatial accuracy. The data were re-projected to NAD 83 coordinates to overlay the orthophotography, but the parcel boundaries will not correspond precisely with features in the images. The parcels were rectified to orthophotography flown in April - May 2000 using geo-referencing tools available in ArcGIS 8.3. This project was completed in July 2005. In general, the parcels meet National Accuracy Standards for 1:24,000 scale maps, and likely exceed that accuracy in urban areas. A complete description of the process is detailed in a series of documents located on a local file server: S:\\\\COMMON\\\\GIS\\\\Documentation\\\\Parcel Rectification & Update Process\\\\Procedure - *. doc. A brief summary is as follows. Individual Assessor Parcel pages or CAD drawings are rectified to the orthophoto. COGO & survey data are used when available and in sufficient quantities to enable the bulk of an Assessor Parcel page to be digitized using said information. Polygons are generated directly from the COGO data, CAD dwg are exported to feature classes, where polygons are then generated, rectified Assessor Parcel pages are vectorized using ArcScan and subsequently polygons are generated. A spatial join is used to assign attributes to the newly generated polygons. Polygons are then assigned an accuracy rank based on source, quality of the fit to the orthophoto, and RMS error encountered during rectification (only the scanned Assessor maps will have and RMS error associated with them). See the fields RANK and DESCRIPTION for information on fit assessment. Areas that have been successfully updated as such have a reasonable expectation of accuracy of +/- 10 and possibly better, areas that have not been updated or are flagged in SCAMP (http://sc-gis/web/scamp/browse.jsp) under the GIS group Projects as Needs Survey Data, the original accuracy assessment of 1:100000 applies.\",\n",

       "  'dc_description_s': 'The dataset \\'\\'ds181_Chinook_ln\\'\\' is a product of the CalFish Adult Salmonid Abundance Database. Data in this shapefile are collected from stream sections or reaches where Chinook population monitoring occurs and that are best represented by linear features. Some escapement monitoring locations are logically represented by point features, such as dams and hatcheries. See the companion point feature shapefile \\'\\'ds180_Chinook_pnts\\'\\' for information collected from point locations.The CalFish Abundance Database contains a comprehensive collection of anadromous fisheries abundance information. Beginning in 1998, the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, began a cooperative project aimed at collecting, archiving, and entering into standardized electronic formats, the wealth of information generated by fisheries resource management agencies and tribes throughout California.The data format provides for sufficient detail to convey the relative accuracy of each population trend index record yet is simple and straight forward enough to be suited for public use. For those interested in more detail the database offers hyperlinks to digital copies of the original documents used to compile the information. In this way the database serves as an information hub directing the user to additional supporting information. This offers utility to field biologists and others interested in obtaining information for more in-depth analysis. Hyperlinks, built into the spatial data attribute tables used in the BIOS and CalFish I-map viewers, open the detailed index data archived in the on-line CalFish database application. The information can also be queried directly from the database via the CalFish Tabular Data Query. Once the detailed annual trend data are in view, another hyperlink opens a digital copy of the document used to compile each record.During 2010, as a part of the Central Valley Chinook Comprehensive Monitoring Plan, the CalFish Salmonid Abundance Database was reorganized and updated. CalFish provides a central location for sharing Central Valley Chinook salmon escapement estimates and annual monitoring reports to all stakeholders, including the public. Annual Chinook salmon in-river escapement indices that were, in many cases, eight to ten years behind are now current though 2009. In some cases, multiple datasets were consolidated into a single, more comprehensive, dataset to more closely reflect how data are reported in the California Department of Fish and Game standard index, Grandtab.Extensive data are currently available in the CalFish Abundance Database for California Chinook, coho, and steelhead. Major data categories include adult abundance population estimates, actual fish and/or carcass counts, counts of fish collected at dams, weirs, or traps, and redd counts. Harvest data has also been compiled for many streams.This CalFish Abundance Database shapefile was generated from fully routed 1:100,000 hydrography. In a few cases streams had to be added to the hydrography dataset in order to provide a means to create shapefiles to represent abundance data associated with them. Streams added were digitized at no more than 1:24,000 scale based on stream line images portrayed in 1:24,000 Digital Raster Graphics (DRG).The features in this layer represent the location for which abundance data records apply. In many cases there are multiple datasets associated with the same location, and so, features may overlap. Please view the associated datasets for detail regarding specific features. In CalFish these are accessed through the \"link\" field that is visible when performing an identify or query operation. A URL string is provided with each feature in the downloadable data which can also be used to access the underlying datasets.The Chinook data that is available from the CalFish website is actually mirrored from the StreamNet website where the CalFish Abundance Database\\'\\'s tabular data is currently stored. Additional information about StreamNet may be downloaded at http://www.streamnet.org.

Intact forest landscape fragments are the best remaining pieces of our once-intact forest landscapes and they are therefore critical to the restoration of ecosystem functioning in areas affected by human development.By mapping the remaining intact forest landscapes within Canada's forest ecozones, we aim provide better information for balancing industry needs and values with the need for recognition of non-market values, many of which are associated with relatively undisturbed forests. Mapping forest fragments provides a baseline from which future assessments of changes to Canada's remaining forest fragments can be made and from which further analysis can be performed to assist forest conservation planning and decision-making.Intact forest landscape fragments were mapped by excluding the following types of disturbances and associated buffer exclusion zone from potential intact forest landscapes:1. Settlements (500m exclusion zone);2. Infrastructure used for communication between settlements and industrial sites; or for industrial exploitation of natural resources (including roads, railways, navigable waterways, pipelines, trunk power transmission lines and other linear disturbances) (1000m exlusion zone for all major roads/highways and 500m exclusion zones for all other linear disturbances);3. Agricultural lands (500m exclusion zone);4. Territories disturbed by economic activities during the last 30-70 years (logging, major reservoirs, mining operation sites, abandoned agricultural lands, etc.) (500m exclusion zone);5. Artificially restored forests, or tree plantations, if their existence can be detected on Landsat satellite imagery (500m exclusion zone);In addition to the disturbances listed above, large waterbodies (&gt;400,000 ha) and waterbodies which represented more than half of a remaining intact forest landscape fragment were also eliminated from the dataset.\\xa0It should be noted that some human impacts are invisible from space, such as small forest roads and paths. Other smaller-scale impacts (including some selective logging) that occurred more than 30-70 years ago often become invisible on satellite imagery and indistinguishable from the natural dynamics of the forest. The maps of Canada's intact forests in Section 2 are based primarily on the visual interpretation of 1988-2002 Landsat images, and some imagery from the 2003-2006 period. Therefore, only more recent human impacts are recorded, which means that there is some overestimation of intact forest landscape areas despite the buffer exclusion zones applied to the disturbance layers that were used to create the intact forest landscape data.\\xa0Citation:Title:\\xa0Canada's Intact Forest Landscapes - 2010Credits:\\xa0Global Forest Watch CanadaPublication Date:\\xa02010Online Linkages:http://datawarehouse.globalforestwatch.ca/\",\n",

The data covers all plants with a combined nameplate capacity of 1 MW (Megawatt) or more.In 2016, most U.S. electricity was generated using fossil fuels. The largest energy source in the U.S. generating 4 trillion kilowatt hours of electricity was natural gas. Natural gas was the source of about 34% of electric generation. The second largest energy source for electricity generation was coal with 30% of all power generation. Petroleum can be burned to produce electric generation, but this source is not a large source in power generation with less than 1% of U.S. electric generation. Nuclear power provided the U.S. with 1/5th of total U.S. electricity or about 20% of all U.S. electricity generation. Renewable energy sources provided 15% of total U.S. electricity in 2016. Hydropower generated 7% of total U.S. electricity generation and about 44% of electricity generation from renewable energy. Electricity generation from wind has increased significantly in the United States since 1970. In 2016, wind power provided almost 6% of U.S. electricity generation and about 37% of electricity generation from renewable energy.Biomass is a material derived from plants or animals and includes lumber, paper mill wastes, food scraps, grass, leaves and paper. Biomass can also include forestry and agricultural residues such as wood chips, corn cobs and wheat straw. However, Biomass has only accounted for 2% of the total U.S. electricity generation in 2016. Solar power produces energy from the sun and in 2016, generated about 1% of U.S. electricity generation. Geothermal power comes from heat energy beneath the surface of the earth. However, here again geothermal power generation was less than 1% of total U.S. electricity generation in 2016.Power PlantsData currency: June 26, 2017Data source:\\xa0MAPSFor more information, please visit:\\xa0Electricity - ExplainedFor feedback:\\xa0ArcGIScomNationalMaps@esri.comThumbnail source image courtesy of:\\xa0Jeanne MenjouletSymbology courtesy of the following\\xa0Noun Project\\xa0contributors:\\xa0Lisa Staudinger, Robert Beerwerth, Nikita Kozin, emilegraphics, Ron Scott, BomSymbols, Andrejs Kirma, Becris, Symbolon and IconathonOther Federal User Community federally focused content that may interest you\\xa0U.S. Department of Energy\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Energy Information Administration\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: USDOE\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: EIA\\xa0',\n",

Please refer to the common ownership polygon layer in http://data.dc.gov for the most current data on ownership.Property Owner Points. This dataset contains points that represent the approximate location of real property lots within the District of Columbia. Each property point is generated based on a corresponding record maintained within the Office of Tax and Revenue (OTR) Real Property Tax Administration's (RPTA) real property database. Each point contains the full attribution of database fields derived from ITS public release extract. The initial data conversion effort was begun in 1997 as a means to provide RPTA with a digital mapping system which could be maintained to reflect ongoing changes to property lots and ownership. The initial step was to scan RPTA tax square maps from aperture cards at an effective paper resolution of 400 DPI. The resulting images were then georeferenced to DC's 0.2-meter resolution 1995 digital orthophotos. During the georeferencing process, the images were not warped; they were simply scaled and rotated to best fit the orthophotos. The DC tax assessor provided a database of active tax accounts which were placed interactively by an operator using the georeferenced square image and the orthophoto. Centroids were placed on the primary structure visible in the orthophoto within the raster property polygon. The placement was performed within ArcView 3.2 using a customized data production application. Accounts which could not be placed in the first pass were then reviewed by another operator to attempt to find their correct location. The placed points were QC'd through a spatial overlay with the square index to assure a match between the square field value within the property database and the actual square polygon into which the point was placed. Spot checking was then performed to confirm that the centroids fell within the correct raster lot. The centroids were delivered to OTR as a single citywide AutoCAD DWG file. Attribute features with square, suffix, and lot numbers (SSLs) were included as an AutoCAD block.\",\n",

Each MOE is expressed in the same units as its corresponding measure; for example, if the estimate value is expressed as a number, then its MOE will also be a number; if the estimate value is expressed as a percent, then its MOE will also be a percent.\\xa0\\xa0The user should also note that for relatively small geographic areas, such as census tracts shown here, ACS only releases combined 5-year estimates, meaning these estimates represent rolling averages of survey results that were collected over a 5-year span (in this case 2013-2017).\\xa0Therefore, these data do not represent any

In order to produce pixel prediction output, we have appended RefineNet upsampling layers described in this\\xa0paper. The model is fully-convolutional, meaning that the model can be applied on an image of any size (constrained by GPU memory, 4096x4096 in our case).Training detailsThe training set consists of 5 million labeled images. Majority of the satellite images cover diverse residential areas in US. For the sake of good set representation, we have enriched the set with samples from various areas covering mountains, glaciers, forests, deserts, beaches, coasts, etc. Images in the set are of 256x256 pixel size with 1 ft/pixel resolution. The training is done with CNTK toolkit using 32 GPUs.MetricsThese are the intermediate stage metrics we use to track DNN model improvements and they are pixel based. The pixel error on the evaluation set is 1.15%. Pixel recall/precision = 94.5%/94.5%PolygonizationMethod descriptionWe developed a method that approximates the prediction pixels into polygons making decisions based on the whole prediction feature space. This is very different from standard approaches, e.g. Douglas-Peucker algorithm, which are greedy in nature. The method tries to impose some of a priory building properties, which are, at the moment, manually defined and automatically tuned. Some of these a priori properties are:The building edge must be of at least some length, both relative and absolute, e.g. 3 metersConsecutive edge angles are likely to be 90 degreesConsecutive angles cannot be very sharp, smaller by some auto-tuned threshold, e.g. 30 degreesBuilding angles likely have very few dominant angles, meaning all building edges are forming angle of (dominant angle\\xa0±nπ/2)In near future, we will be looking to deduce this automatically from existing building information.MetricsBuilding matching metrics:MetricValuePrecision99.3%Recall93.5%We track various metrics to measure the quality of the output:Intersection over Union – This is the standard metric measuring the overlap quality against the labelsShape distance – With this metric we measure the polygon outline similarityDominant angle rotation error – This measures the polygon rotation deviationOn our evaluation set contains ~15k building. The metrics on the set are:IoU is 0.85, Shape distance is 0.33, Average rotation error is 1.6 degreesThe metrics are better or similar compared to OSM building metrics against the labelsData VintageThe vintage of the footprints depends on the vintage of the underlying imagery. Because Bing Imagery is a composite of multiple sources it is difficult to know the exact dates for individual pieces of data.How good are the data?Our metrics show that in the vast majority of cases the quality is at least as good as data hand digitized buildings in OpenStreetMap. It is not perfect, particularly in dense urban areas but it is still awesome.What is the coordinate reference system?EPSG: 4326Why are the data being released?Microsoft has a continued interest in supporting a thriving OpenStreetMap ecosystem.',\n",

The data covers all plants with a combined nameplate capacity of 1 MW (Megawatt) or more.In 2016, most U.S. electricity was generated using fossil fuels. The largest energy source in the U.S. generating 4 trillion kilowatt hours of electricity was natural gas. Natural gas was the source of about 34% of electric generation. The second largest energy source for electricity generation was coal with 30% of all power generation. Petroleum can be burned to produce electric generation, but this source is not a large source in power generation with less than 1% of U.S. electric generation. Nuclear power provided the U.S. with 1/5th of total U.S. electricity or about 20% of all U.S. electricity generation. Renewable energy sources provided 15% of total U.S. electricity in 2016. Hydropower generated 7% of total U.S. electricity generation and about 44% of electricity generation from renewable energy. Electricity generation from wind has increased significantly in the United States since 1970. In 2016, wind power provided almost 6% of U.S. electricity generation and about 37% of electricity generation from renewable energy.Biomass is a material derived from plants or animals and includes lumber, paper mill wastes, food scraps, grass, leaves and paper. Biomass can also include forestry and agricultural residues such as wood chips, corn cobs and wheat straw. However, Biomass has only accounted for 2% of the total U.S. electricity generation in 2016. Solar power produces energy from the sun and in 2016, generated about 1% of U.S. electricity generation. Geothermal power comes from heat energy beneath the surface of the earth. However, here again geothermal power generation was less than 1% of total U.S. electricity generation in 2016.Power PlantsData currency: June 26, 2017Data source:\\xa0MAPSFor more information, please visit:\\xa0Electricity - ExplainedFor feedback:\\xa0ArcGIScomNationalMaps@esri.comThumbnail source image courtesy of:\\xa0Jeanne MenjouletSymbology courtesy of the following\\xa0Noun Project\\xa0contributors:\\xa0Lisa Staudinger, Robert Beerwerth, Nikita Kozin, emilegraphics, Ron Scott, BomSymbols, Andrejs Kirma, Becris, Symbolon and IconathonOther Federal User Community federally focused content that may interest you\\xa0U.S. Department of Energy\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Energy Information Administration\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: USDOE\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: EIA\\xa0',\n",

       "  'dc_description_s': \"The ABMIw2wLCV2010 was derived by applying a semantic and spatial generalization algorithm (Castilla et al., in preparation), and later updating to 2010 conditions, to a combination of two raster datasets: the Canadian Forest Service (CFS) Earth Observation for Sustainable Development (EOSD) LC dataset, and the Land Cover for Agricultural Regions of Canada, circa 2000 (LCARC, a.k.a. NLWIS) dataset of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC). Both datasets were created using digital classification of Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 ortho-images acquired around year 2000, with each Landsat scene classified individually and then mosaicked into the final raster product. NB. Both rasters use the same hierachical classification scheme. This feature class was obtained by merging 48 individual tiles whose frames are provided in the ABMIw2wLCV2000_48tiles feature class. Each tile is completely within a single Landsat scene, and its boundary roughly coincides with the seam lines used to stitch together the EOSD. Each map tile was created as follows:(0) The EOSD and NLWIS rasters were combined into a single raster according to a ruleset that selects a label for each pixel based on the values for that pixel in the two rasters. See the description of the SOURCE* fields in the ABMIw2wLCV2000_48tiles for further details. Lakes, rivers, pipelines, powerlines, railways and roads from the Government of Alberta (GoA) GIS layers were also 'burned' in this combined raster.(1) A morphological segmentation algorithm is applied to the gradient magnitude (a sort of 'edge' image) of the original Landsat image used to derive the EOSD, in order to break it down into a mosaic of tiny homogeneous regions (mean segment size around 10 pixels) separated by 1-pixel thick boundaries. NB. The edges of the features copied from the GoA's layers area are enhanced in the gradient magnitude image so as to preserve their shape in the output segmentation.(2)Regions having a clearly predominant landcover class ( more than 75% of its pixels belong to that class) are assigned to it, and adjacent regions having the same class are merged together. This results in a big portion of the image (usually more than 90%) being already labeled.(3)Endmembers, or typical spectral signatures (i.e., mean value in each band of the Landsat image) for each class are derived from these regions. (4)Unlabeled regions are assigned to the class of the most similar neighbour, providing the latter is already classified and bears enough similarity to it, ortherwise they are assigned to the class with the highest relative abundace within the region, where the latter is abundance weighted by distance in the feature space between the spectral signature of the region and the endmember of each class. Once again, adjacent regions having the same class are merged together after the assigment. NB. There are special rules on how to deal with semantically related classes, such as conifer, broadleaf and mixed forest. (5) Regions are reclassified into the final set of 11 landcover classes using a predefined crosswalk table, after which adjacent regions having the same class are merged together. NB. Treed wetlands (class 81 in EOSD) greater than 100 ha are assumed to be black spruce and thus conifer. Smaller treed wetlands are assigned to the class of the closest forest endmembers.(6) Regions smaller than the minimum mapping unit (MMU: 0.5 ha for water and 2 ha for the rest) are merged to their most similar adjacent neighbour. (7) Isolated regions smaller than 25 ha that show a low contrast with the encompassing region were eliminated, as they were found in a previous version to mainly correspond to spurious polygons.(8) Using the center of boundary pixels as initial vertices, the result is converted to an ESRI polygon shapefile using a line simplification algorithm. Once all tiles were ready, the final product was created by merging and dissolving the individual tiles into a seamless layer. After dissolving, a few seam lines were still visible due to differing classifications in the adjoining tiles. The labels of polygons affected by these inconsistencies were harmonized using semi-automated GIS procedures, after which a final 'dissolve' was performed.The circa 2000 map was updated to circa 2010 conditions using a hybrid procedure that included a combination of change detection and GIS techniques. The map was updated for new features appearing in the 2000-2010 period of the following types: forestry cutblocks, wildfires, surface mines, roads and urban development. Cutblocks were extracted from the cumulative ABMI cutblock layer. A difference image (NDVI2000 – NDVI2010) was computed, and statistics for each cutblock polygon were derived. Cutblocks harvested between 2000 and 2010 were preselected by thresholding and those close to the threshold were visually inspected before the final selection. The wildfires were extracted from GoA’s Historical Wildfire Perimeter Dataset using a similar procedure than for the cutblocks. Mines, roads and urban were extracted from the 2010 ABMI Human Footprint dataset using GIS overlay operations that compared these with preexisting features of this type in the 2000 map. The different types of new features were integrated into a single disturbance layer, the outlines of this layer were generalized to give them a similar appearance than those of the 2000 map, the disturbance layer was stamped on top of the 2000 map, and slivers (small polygons resulting from boundary mistmatches) were removed. The Landcover_Polygons_2010 feature class has a new field called ‘MOD_TY’ (modifier type) that records the type of disturbance a new polygon not belonging to the developed class is. Possible values are ‘Cutblock’, ‘Burnt’, ‘Mining’ and ‘Tailing pond’ (the latter belongs to water class). NB. Cutblocks, mines and other disturbance features that already existed in 2000 have their MOD_TY field blank in this version.Landcover class definitions (field LC_class):20 - Water: lakes, lagoons, rivers, canals, and artificial water bodies. Shallow open water is included in this category, unless there is more than 20% vegetation cover, in which case it belongs to the relevant vegetated class.31 - Snow/Ice: areas permanently covered by snow or ice, including glaciers. 32 - Rock/Rubble: bedrock, rubble, talus, blockfield, lava beds, or other natural impervious surfaces. 33 - Exposed Land: bare soil (barren, non-agricultural), river sediments and cutbanks, pond or lake sediments, reservoir margins, beaches, landings, fresh (less than 1yr) cutblocks, recently burned areas, mudflat sediments, surface mining, or other non-vegetated (less than 10% trees, or less than 20% shrub/herb) surfaces. 34 - Developed: urban and built-up areas (including industrial sites), impervious artificial surfaces (e.g. airport runaways), railways and roads. Acreages and farmsteads are included in this class. Oil and gas well pads are included in this class if connected to a road and not abandoned or under reclamation. Urban terrain under development is included in this class, even if the land is exposed. Urban green areas are excluded of this class if larger than 2 ha and if they have less than 2 buildings per hectare. 50 - Shrubland: At least 20% ground cover which is at least one-third shrub (shrub: a woody plant not considered a tree), with no or little presence of trees (less than10% crown closure). Examples of plants belonging to this class in Alberta are alder, willow, juniper, and sagebrush. Shrubby fens and other non-treed woody wetlands, usually associated with floodplains and the shores of lakes and streams, belong to this class. Recent clearcuts and forest fires are initially labeled as shrubland to differntiate them from the surrounding forest.110 - Grassland: Predominantly native grasses and other non-woody vegetation (e.g., forbs) with a minimum of 20% ground cover. May include some shrub cover (but less than a third of the vegetated area) or a few trees (but the tree cover cannot exceed 10%). Land used for range with native unimproved grasses (a.k.a. rough pasture) is included in this class. Alpine meadows fall into this class. Marshes and other non-woody wetlands with at least 20% vegetation cover (sedges, cattails, or moss) belong to this class. NB. A forestry cutblock harvested more than year ago that contains seedlings, but where the latter cover less than 10% of the area of the cutblock, belongs to this class. If the cutblock had no successful regeneration and was covered by more than 20% shrubs, then it would belong to the 'shrubland' class.120 - Agriculture: annually cultivated crops, tame pastures (fields planted or sown with non-native grasses/legumes where livestock is directly grazing on them in the summer), forage crops (same as the previous, but instead of grazed, cut for hay) and woody perennial crops (fruit orchards and vineyards). Bare agricultural (i.e., tilled) soil belongs to this class and not to 'exposed land'.210 - Coniferous Forest: Treed areas with at least a 10% ground cover of trees (a.k.a. crown closure), where coniferous trees (spruce, pine, fir, larch) are 75% or more of the crown closure. Young plantations or regenerating cutblocks of conifer trees belong to this class no matter that the trees are less than 5 m tall, providing crown closure has reached 10%. Treed wetlands (e.g., black spruce bogs and fens) are included in this class providing they are conifer dominated and crown closure exceeds10%.220 - Broadleaf Forest: Treed areas with at least a 10% ground cover of trees, where broadleaf trees (trembling aspen, balsam poplar, white birch) are 75% or more of the crown closure. Young plantations or regenerating cutblocks of broadleaf trees belong to this class no matter that the trees are less than 5 m tall, providing crown closure has reached 10%. Treed swamps along river floodplains and other treed wetlands are included in this class providing they are broadleaf dominated and crown closure exceeds 10%.230 - Mixed Forest: Treed areas with at least a 10% ground cover of trees, where neither coniferous nor broadleaf trees account for 75% or more of crown closure.The overall thematic accuracy of the map, as estimated by an extensive validation dataset (see description of the relevant feature class) is 75% with 11 classes, and 88% if these classes are grouped into 5 general classes. User and Producer accuracies for specific classes in each level appear in tables appended to this geodatabase. Caveats:The width of roads has been systematically exaggerated to a minimum of 60 m (two Landsat pixels); therefore the real extent of the Developed class is greatly overestimated.Forest areas harvested or burned between 2000 and 2010 were assigned to the ‘Shrub’ LC class to differentiate them from their surroundings. They can be identified using the ‘MOD_TY’ field, which will respectively contain the value ‘Cutblock’ or ‘Burnt’.The accuracy of the shrub class is low (30%). Many shrub polygons are in reality forest (beyond new cutblocks and burnt areas), especially in the North. This was not possible to correct with the input data at hand.\",\n",

This includes performing soil improvement and watershed restoration, wildlife habitat improvement, control of insects, disease, and noxious weeds, tree planting, seeding and other cultural treatments necessary to maintain and improve land productivity. Since its creation millions of acres of National Forest System lands (NFS) have been treated and restored to resilient conditions and terrestrial and aquatic habitat improved. Public Law 109-54 of August 2, 2005, Title IV General Provisions, Sec 412 further amended the K-V Act to allow the collection and use of CWKV funds for watershed restoration, wildlife habitat improvement, to prepare timber sales, control of insects, disease, and noxious weeds, fire community protection activities, and the maintenance of forest roads within the Forest Service region in which the timber sale occurred. Provided that such activities may be performed through the use of contracts, forest product sales, and cooperative agreements. Note that these activities are to be performed by contract and not Forest Service personnel. The Forest Service used this amendment to administratively create two K-V programs within the K-V fund; CWKV (Cooperative Work, Knutson-Vandenberg, Sale Area Projects) and CWK2 (Cooperative Work, Knutson-Vandenberg, Regional Projects). This layer shows the spatial representation where activities accomplished and funded with CWKV and CWK2 funds and reported through the Forest Service Activity Tracking System (FACTS) database. It is important to note that this layer may not contain all CWKV or CWK2 accomplished activities; the spatial portion of the activity description is not currently enforced by FACTS and at this time some are optionally reported by Forest Service units. As spatial data reporting is enforced by the application and acceptant of reporting both tabular and spatial we hope to improve the quality and comprehensiveness of the data used for this layer in coming years.\\xa0Metadata',\n",

       "  'dc_description_s': '(Link to Metadata) High-resolution impervious surfaces dataset for the Lake Champlain Basin, Vermont and New York. Two impervious classes were mapped: (1) Roads\\\\Railroads; and (2) Other Impervious. The latter category included parking lots, driveways, sidewalks, and buildings. Pertinent imagery could not be obtained for the Quebec portion of the Lake Champlain Basin, which was thus excluded from the final product. The primary source used to derive this impervious surfaces layer was 1-meter resolution National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) data acquired in 2011. The NAIP datasets covering the study area were 4-band aerial imagery, meaning that they contained a Near Infrared band in addition to the visible bands (i.e., Red, Green, Blue). This band improved the utility of the imagery, permitting use of vegetation indices that rely on the Near Infrared and Red bands (e.g., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). Ancillary data sources included various thematic vector GIS datasets, including the Lake Champlain Basin watershed boundary, lakes, stream centerlines, road centerlines, railroad centerlines, and building points. This impervious surfaces dataset is considered current as of 2011. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were used to extract impervious surfaces using the best available remotely-sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment, a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were used to ensure that the end product was both accurate and cartographically coherent. It is important to note that the mapping protocol described above was a \"top-down\" approach: impervious surfaces were mapped when they were visible in the available aerial imagery. In practical terms, impervious surfaces were not captured by the mapping process when they were obscured by tree canopy. Although this modeling limitation means that the total area of extant impervious surfaces would be underestimated in subsequent analyses, it also provides a better estimate of surfaces whose environmental effects are not mitigated by overhanging vegetation. Indeed, one of the well-known benefits of trees is that they absorb or slow rainwater before it hits the ground, so the top-down approach is a reasonable and effective method for mapping the impervious surfaces that most affect stormwater runoff volume. The draft impervious maps produced by automated feature extraction were extensively reviewed for accuracy, coherence, and aesthetic quality, and errors of omission and commission were fixed as necessary. Accuracy assessments were then conducted separately for the two sides of the Basin, indicating an overall accuracy of 99% for Vermont and 99% for New York. The overall accuracy for the combined area was also 99%. The user\\'s accuracies for Roads/Railroads, Other Impervious, and Not Impervious were 98%, 98%, and 100% respectively.',\n",

This will improve their ability to plan for treatment opportunities. Users should be aware that this is done at a landscape level and the status of specific units may differ with more site-specific information. Treatment priorities were developed by first assessing the landscape-level issues and risks, then assigning a relative ranking of treatments according to stand attributes. These assessments and rankings were combined spatially and each stand was scored to assign a relative priority for each treatment.Descriptions\\xa0of each layer are outlined below.LAYERS:\\xa0TREATMENT - Wildfire Mitigation and\\xa0TREATMENT - Wildfire RehabDescription:\\xa0A range of treatment opportunities can exist with wildfire-impacted stands, depending on the pre-fire stand conditions, fire size, and fire intensity. For instance, rehabilitating stands with high volumes and a light intensity burn is a higher priority than those with low volume and a high intensity burn. Recovery of any merchantable volume from these stands will support short- and mid-term harvest levels while long-term harvest levels will increase because of the regeneration volumes are significantly improved. Rehabilitating burned stands should also help to address other issues like fire hazard abatement and watershed recovery.\\xa0Wildfire rehabilitation activities typically involve large equipment to salvage trees or knock them down to be piled and burned. Site preparation might also be required to improve conditions for natural regeneration or planting the next crop of trees. Other specialized treatments may be required to address non-timber values associated with wildfire-impacted stands (e.g., riparian reserves).\\xa0Sufficient time must have passed (at least 3 years) prior to treatment so that salvage opportunities that may transfer a legal reforestation obligation onto another party are exhausted and natural regeneration opportunities to establish sufficient stocking are no longer a reasonable option.Objectives:\\xa0Key objectives for rehabilitating wildfire-impacted stands include:accelerate the recovery of stands into productive forests that will be available for harvest sooner (e.g., younger stands without merchantable volume, including fire-damaged areas).\\xa0recover merchantable volume that would not otherwise be harvested.abate fire hazards associated with standing dead trees and damage to understory trees as the dead material falls.Challenges:\\xa0Key challenges involved with rehabilitating wildfire-impacted stands include:Estimates of fire intensity are not readily available. These are used to develop more reasonable estimates of the available live and dead volume.The areas (polygons) impacted by wildfire are not always accurate.More complex planning processes given multiple stakeholders and tenure holders – particularly private landowners.Identification of stands with sufficient natural regeneration.Costs associated with accessing wildfire-impacted stands that require new road systems.\\xa0LAYER:\\xa0TREATMENT - MPB RehabDescription:\\xa0Many MPB-attacked stands will remain on the landbase because they have lost so much of their merchantable volume that they are no longer economically viable to harvest. Effectively, these stands cease to contribute to the working forest. Within this profile, a continuum of stands exists ranging from marginally economic to uneconomic:Marginally economic stands: some green volume and larger piece sizes to produce lumber, pulp chips and potentially bio-fuel feed stocks (similar for stands treated under the ITSL program).Uneconomic stands: younger, small-diameter trees, higher percent dead and long haul distances.Recovery of any merchantable (green) volume from these stands will support mid-term harvest levels while long-term harvest levels will increase because of the regeneration volumes are significantly improved. Rehabilitating damaged stands should also help to address other issues like fire hazard abatement and watershed recovery.MPB rehabilitation activities typically involve large equipment to harvest trees or knock them down to be piled and burned. Site preparation might also be required to improve conditions for natural regeneration or planting the next crop of trees.Sufficient time must have passed (at least 3 years) prior to treatment so that salvage opportunities that may transfer a legal reforestation obligation onto another party are exhausted and natural regeneration opportunities to establish sufficient stocking are no longer a reasonable option.Objectives:\\xa0Key objectives for rehabilitating MPB-Attacked stands include:accelerate the recovery of stands into productive forests that will be available for harvest sooner (e.g., younger stands without merchantable volume, including fire-damaged areas).\\xa0recover some merchantable (green) volume from unsalvaged stands that would not otherwise be harvested – particularly within the mid-term (post-salvage period).abate fire hazards associated with standing dead trees and damage to understory trees as the dead material falls.Criteria:\\xa0The criteria described in the table below\\xa0were used to rank eligible stands for rehabilitating MPB-attacked stands.Criteria and Priority for Rehabilitating MPB-Impacted StandsCriteriaNo TreatmentRank 3Rank 2Rank 1BEC ZoneNullsn/aMS, ESSF, SBS, SBPSBG, IDF, ICHStand Age (yrs)Nulls &amp; &lt;40n/a≥40 &amp; &lt;100 yrs≥100 yrsInventory Site IndexNulls&lt;9.3 m50≥ 9.3 &amp; &lt;12.3 m50≥12.3 m50Stand Dead PercentNulls &amp; &lt;40≥40 &amp; &lt;56 %≥56 &amp; &lt;71 %≥71 %Live VolumeNulls &amp; &lt;40n/a≥40 &amp; &lt;60 m³/ha≥60 m³/haAccess (cycle time class)Nulls &amp; ≥7≥5 &amp; &lt;7 hrs≥3 &amp; &lt;5 hrs&lt;3 hrsResulting Area (ha) by Rank\\xa0289,07864,777484Each stand is assigned the rank associated with the lowest threshold of all criteria.Unfortunately, reliable spatial data is not readily available for some rehabilitation criteria. While they were not assessed directly in this analysis, the following criteria should be considered at the operational planning and field verification stages:During the salvage period, target stands rejected from normal harvest plans and dropped from consideration into a cutting permit. These may also be identified as eligible stands with larger trees starting to tip over from decay.Avoid stands, or portions, with adequate secondary structure expected to develop into operable stands.Challenges:\\xa0A major challenge with rehabilitating MPB-attacked stands is identifying treatment opportunities, as it is difficult to determine which stands may not be salvaged by the TSA licensees.\\xa0In addition, opportunities to rehabilitate most stands will be limited by access. It is likely that the cost is prohibitive to build new road systems into some stands.\\xa0LAYER:\\xa0TREATMENT - Fir Stand EnhancementDescription:\\xa0Absence of understorey fires has resulted in a high level of in-growth, and unnaturally high density (especially in the understorey) Douglas-fir stands. There is also concern that catastrophic wildfires may occur due to the high fuel accumulations associated with dense stands, and a shift from ground fires to crown fires.The anticipated benefits of this strategy include improving both timber and non-timber resources, such as mule deer habitat and urban interface fuels reduction. Expected gains in merchantable volume post thinning should increase available volumes in the mid- to long-term. It is also anticipated that treated stands are less likely to experience defoliation from spruce budworm because foliage is less palatable and tree response to damage is more vigorous (resilient).This treatment involves thinning (i.e., mechanical tree spacing) stagnant thickets in the second and third layers of dry-belt Douglas-fir stands. Research on these stands suggests this strategy can rehabilitate stands partially harvested with diameter-limit cutting, which promotes excessive stocking in the lower layers that behave as if they are repressed.Objectives:\\xa0Key objectives for thinning Dry-Belt Douglas-fir stands include:improve both timber and non-timber resources, such as mule deer habitat and urban interface fuels reduction.increase merchantable volume post thinning and thereby increase available volumes in the mid- to long-term.reduce defoliation from spruce budworm as foliage is less palatable and tree response to damage is more vigorous (resilient).\\xa0abate fire hazards by reducing dense thickets and ladder fuels that can shift fires from the ground to\\xa0 the crown.Criteria:\\xa0The criteria described in Table 15 were used to rank eligible stands for thinning dry-belt Douglas-fir. This selection of stands is expected to over-represent the extent of the opportunity so refinement is required for each prescription – including determining that these stands have not been thinned before.The current inventory poorly reflects multi-storied stands but local knowledge suggests that dense thickets are often associated with stands partially harvested between 1960 and 1980.While stands within Mule Deer Winter Ranges would also benefit from this treatment, the return on investment is expected to be too low to warrant treatment based on timber values alone. Consideration should be given to treating these stands for other values.\\xa0Challenges:\\xa0Key challenges involved with thinning dry-belt Douglas-fir stands include:Current inventory does not capture stocking for young stands very well and site quality may be underestimated.Despite the completion of substantial pre-commercial thinning area through various programs, treatment records in RESULTS may be incomplete (especially the spatial component).\\xa0LAYER:\\xa0TREATMENT - Pine ThinningDescription:\\xa0Numerous examples of high density, fire-origin pine stands expressing repression occur throughout the Cariboo region – predominantly on the Chilcotin Plateau. While spacing opportunities have been considered, most areas were deemed unsuitable due to forest health concerns. Currently, there is little or no future timber value in these areas but research suggests that a combination of thinning and fertilization can ameliorate these extremely dense pines stands originating from wildfire disturbances.\\xa0This treatment generally involves thinning (i.e., mechanical tree spacing) dense, repressed stands immediately followed with a single fertilization treatment.Objectives:\\xa0Key objectives for thinning repressed pine stands include:mitigate the reduction in site index from height growth repression. Evidence suggests that the earlier the spacing the greater the mitigation of the site index lossimprove stand quality/health/resilience through leave tree selection, andincrease stand volumes through fertilization and advance operability in these stands.\\xa0Challenges:\\xa0Key challenges involved with thinning repressed pine stands include:Current inventory does not capture stocking for young stands very well and potentially repressed pine stands are not classified.The return on investment is difficult to rationalize due to the high treatment costs, long return period, and potential for loss due to wildfire, pests, and diseases.\\xa0LAYER:\\xa0TREATMENT - Open Forest RestorationDescription:\\xa0A significant area of dry forest ecosystems occur throughout the interior of British Columbia. These ecosystems are referred to as “dry-belt”, “Natural Disturbance Type 4 (NDT4)”, or “open range / open forest”. Since the early 1900’s, fire suppression has allowed trees to encroach onto hundreds of thousands of hectares of the natural grasslands and the naturally open forest types in the NDT4.Ecosystem restoration is the process of assisting with the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged or destroyed. These treatments aim to re-establish structural characteristics, species composition and ecological process. In BC, ecosystem restoration examples include the reintroduction of ground fires in NDT4 (fire maintained) ecosystems, incorporating\\xa0 snags, coarse woody debris (CWD) or canopy gaps in homogenous secondary forests, rehabilitation of compacted landings and access roads, and the control of invasive species such as knapweed, thistles and broom.At this time, the scope of this land-based investment planning exercise excludes the identification of more specialized treatments such as addressing road impacts, controlling invasive species, and restoring riparian habitat. Instead, treatment priorities focus on open forest.Open Forest\\xa0– Lands ecologically suitable for production of large crowned trees in an open forest with bunchgrass and dry land shrub species.\\xa0 Snow accumulations are typically light.\\xa0 Generally include &lt;40% tree crown closure, multi-stories stand structure and low stocking (tree regeneration) levels.In historically fire-maintained ecosystems of the Cariboo, the lack of wildfire or similar disturbance has contributed to trees encroaching onto grasslands, as well as, excessive in-growth of trees in previously open forests. Treatments for open forest/open range typically involve activities like prescribed burning, tree knockdown (slashing), partial cutting, thinning, and mechanical site preparation.Objectives:\\xa0Key objectives for ecosystem restoration include:shift stands from their current vegetated condition towards a desired future condition,partially replace natural processes of frequent ground fires that ignited easily and spread rapidly through extensive areas of ungrazed grass,encourage shrub and herbaceous vegetation development, andenhance Douglas- fir stem growth and vigor while not decreasing overall stand growth.Criteria:\\xa0The criteria described in the table below\\xa0were used to rank eligible stands for ecosystem restoration of stands towards an open forest condition.Criteria and Priority for Ecosystem Restoration of Open ForestCriteriaNo TreatmentRank 3Rank 2Rank 1ER Alignment (Current to Desired Condition) – Open ForestNulls &amp; Goodn/aModeratePoorGrassland Benchmarkn/aNullsNoYesAccess (cycle time class)Nulls &amp; 9997 (≥5 &amp; &lt;7 hrs)5 (≥3 &amp; &lt;5 hrs)3 (&lt;3 hrs)Resulting Area (ha) by Rank\\xa013,027136,311373Each stand is assigned the rank associated with the lowest threshold of all criteria.Challenges:\\xa0Key challenges involved with restoring historically adapted ecosystems include:More complex planning processes given multiple stakeholders and tenure holders – particularly private landowners.Identification of rare and endangered species and ecosystemsLAYER:\\xa0TREATMENT - Open Range RestorationDescription:\\xa0A significant area of dry forest ecosystems occur throughout the interior of British Columbia.

The enhanced basic silviculture treatment is intended to be applied where current performance is not optimal over the long-term (i.e., achieving minimum well-spaced trees/ha versus target well-spaced trees/ha).A suite of specific activities are available for this treatment; aimed to increase initial well-spaced stand densities and reduce stocking gaps. Specific activities include a combination of site preparation, planting to higher densities, and/or fill planting as soon as ingress is complete. Planting would also utilize Class A seed with volume gains associated with it.A portion of these treatments is expected to exceed basic silviculture activities currently being applied on these stands. As this is clearly defined, forest licensees and BC Timber Sales may seek operational cost allowance to offset the additional costs.Objectives:\\xa0The key objective for enhanced basic silviculture stands is to increase timber volume and quality when these stands are harvested.This strategy will only influence stands regenerated in the future that will not be harvested for at least 45-50yrs from now. While this treatment may provide some benefit at the end of the mid-term trough, it is focused on increasing long-term harvest levels by improving well-spaced densities, reducing stocking gaps (OAF1), decreasing regeneration delay, and realizing genetic gains from using Class A seed. In addition to the timber supply benefits, the higher density stands with this activity could result in timber quality improvements such as lower knot sizes, reduced risks from damaging agents and climate change, and provide options for further stand management.Criteria:\\xa0Eligible stands for this aggressive regeneration treatment are limited to the better sites within the TSA.\\xa0Challenges:\\xa0Key challenges involved with the enhanced basic silviculture treatment include:The predictive ecosystem mapping is a landscape-level inventory that is not accurately define the extent of eligible stands. These units must be verified in the field. At the same time, enhanced basic silviculture treatments on additional units are also likely to improve timber volume and quality at rotation.Clearly defining the acceptable costs associated with enhancements above basic silviculture requirements so that this portion of these activities is eligible for stumpage allowance.',\n",

Data was provided by CA Deparment of Fish and Game. This dataset is a subset of the Tuolumne Aquatic Resources Relational Inventory (TARRI) compiled by Brian Quelvog, California Department of Fish and Game. The database focuses on estimates of fish populations in the central Sierra Nevada counties specifically Tuolumne, Calaveras, Stanislaus, Mariposa, Mono, and Alpine counties. Information includes the number of individuals per species collected during each of two or three passes with backpack electrofisher(s), section length, section width, date, species sampled, the identifier, UTM coordinates, and (if available) photographs of the site. The species documented include rainbow and brown trout, centrachids such as bluegill and green sunfish, cyprinids such as roach and hitch, as well as other groups (eg. mosquitofish and catfish). Over seventy-five sources of information were used in making the data set including aquatic surveys by several agencies, although most of the information is contained in file reports from the California Department of Fish and Game. Collection dates range from 1979 to 2003. What each record represents Each record represents the collection, identification, and count of one species of fish during one of two or three passes with backpack electrofisher(s), the zone, water, site, UTM coordinates, date, and person or organization responsible for the survey.The TARRI database was developed to:\\xa0demonstrate the feasibility of compiling a significant amount of the known aquatic fauna data for a finite geographical area.provide resource managers with a foundation of information on what species have occurred in the area and under what conditions (reference conditions). This will allow data-driven decisions on appropriate monitoring and management activities to ensure protection of the resources.\\xa0provide the means to integrate related datasets from available information on species occurrence, population dynamics and habitat conditions to allow fisheries managers to make informed decisions in areas such as setting angling regulations and watershed planning.

NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.&quot;\\xa0Original metadata.BLM National Conservation Land Wilderness:\\xa0Sierra Water Workgroup has produced this layer depicting a portion of the BLM's National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) Wilderness Areas, Wilderness Study Areas, and areas that have been released through congressional action. This data set represents is a\\xa0region of the Sierra Nevada and is not the conclusive list.\\xa0The Bureau of Land Management's National Conservation Lands, also known as the National Landscape Conservation System, contain some of the West’s most spectacular landscapes. They include 871 federally recognized areas and approximately 31 million acres of National Monuments, National Conservation Areas, Wilderness Areas, Wilderness Study Areas, Wild and Scenic Rivers, National Scenic and Historic Trails, and Conservation Lands of the California Desert.A Wilderness is a special place where the earth and its community of life are essentially undisturbed; they retain a primeval character, without permanent improvements and generally appear to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature. In 1964, Congress established the National Wilderness Preservation System and designated the first Wilderness Areas in passing the Wilderness Act. The uniquely American idea of wilderness has become an increasingly significant tool to ensure long-term protection of natural landscapes. Wilderness protects the habitat of numerous wildlife species and serves as a biodiversity bank for many species of plants and animals. Wilderness is also a source of clean water. Data was sourced by the US BLM - California,\\xa0original metadata\\xa0here.Northern Sierra Nevada Foothills wildlife corridors:\\xa0Sierra Water Workgroup has produced this layer depicting Incorporated Cities within the Yosemite-Mariposa IRWM region. Data was sourced as part of the\\xa0Northern Sierra Nevada Foothills (NSNF) wildlife connectivity project, which modeled wildlife corridors for focal species between 271 landscape blocks within the northern Sierra Nevada foothills and neighboring ecoregions. The linkages incorporate data and information for 30 focal species, including 9 passage species (species that move through the corridor) and 21 corridor dwellers (species that may take more than one generation to move through a corridor). The linkages are made up of a least-cost corridor union and additional habitat patch information for corridor dwellers. The least-cost union is a union of the least-cost corridor analysis, based on species specific habitat models, for nine focal passage species (total number of corridors identified for each species follows the species name): black bear (47), black-tailed jackrabbit (105), bobcat (81), dusky-footed woodrat (98), gray fox (85), mountain lion (66), mule deer (134), western gray squirrel (99) and western pond turtle (84). Many species corridors were overlapping despite diverse habitat needs and the use of species specific data to build the habitat suitability models. Habitat areas for corridor dwellers, based on habitat suitability modeling and patch analysis, was added to the least-cost union: We identified all habitat patches within the corridor union, measured distance between each habitat patch to make sure it was within the maximum dispersal distance for that corridor dweller, and when needed added habitat near the corridor edge to meet the species dispersal needs. Redundant corridors were deleted to provide cleaner linkage areas. This analysis identified multiple swaths of habitat that species have the potential to reside in or move through. To ensure that ecological processes were protected in each linkage, we imposed a minimum width of 1 km for linkages.\\xa0For more information see the\\xa0original report. Data\\xa0was\\xa0provided by the\\xa0California Department of Fish and Wildlife, Biogeographic Data Branch Conservation Analysis Unit, and was published in January 2015.\\xa0Land Cover 2011:\\xa0Sierra Water Workgroup has produced this layer depicting land coverage in the Yosemite-Mariposa IRWM area. Data was provided by the USGS NLCD 2011 Land Cover (2011 Edition).The National Land Cover Database products are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). The success of NLCD over nearly two decades is credited to the continuing collaborative spirit of the agencies that make up the MRLC. NLCD 2011 is the most up-to-date iteration of the National Land Cover Database, the definitive Landsat-based, 30-meter resolution land cover database for the Nation. The data in NLCD 2011 are completely integrated with NLCD 2001 (2011 Edition) and NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition). For NLCD 2011, there are 5 primary data products: 1) NLCD 2011 Land Cover; 2) NLCD 2006/2011 Land Cover Change Pixels labeled with the 2011 land cover class; 3) NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness; 4) NLCD 2006/2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Pixels; and 5) NLCD 2011 Tree Canopy Cover provided by an MRLC partner - the U.S.D.A. Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications Center. In addition, ancillary metadata includes the NLCD 2011 Path/Row Index vector file showing the footprint of Landsat scenes and change analysis pairs used to derive 2006/2011 spectral change. All Landsat scene acquisition dates are included in the attribute table. Also, as part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2001 and 2006 land cover and impervious data products have been revised and reissued (2011 Edition) to provide full compatibility with the new NLCD 2011 products. NLCD Tree Canopy Cover was created using MRLC mapping zones from NLCD 2001 (see Tree Canopy Cover metadata for additional detail). All other NLCD 2011 products were created on a path/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product. Questions about the NLCD 2011 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2011 land cover mapping team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD.Dams with Nonearthen Shores:\\xa0Sierra Water Workgroup has modified this layer displaying &quot;nonearthen shores&quot; within the Yosemite-Mariposa Integrated Regional Water Management Area.

Data was provided by USGS.The California Groundwater Units dataset classifies and delineates areas within the State of California into one of three groundwater-based polygon units: (1) those areas previously defined as alluvial groundwater basins or subbasins, (2) highland areas that are adjacent to and topographically upgradient of groundwater basins, and (3) highland areas not associated with a groundwater basin, only a hydrogeologic province. In total, 938 Groundwater Units are represented. The Groundwater Units dataset relates existing groundwater basins with their newly delineated highland areas which can be used in subsequent hydrologic studies. The methods used to delineate groundwater-basin-associated highland areas are similar to those used to delineate a contributing area (such as for a lake or water body); the difference is that highland areas are constrained to the immediately surrounding upslope (upstream) area. Upslope basins have their own delineated highland.\\xa0Original Metadata.Census County Divisions:\\xa0Sierra Water Workgroup has produced this layer depicting Census County Divisions within the Mariposa County IRWM region.

Watershed Boundary data for this was provided by the USGS National Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). From USGS:\\xa0“WBD provides a uniquely identified and uniform method of subdividing large drainage areas. The data is intended to be used as a tool for water-resource management and planning activities, particularly for site-specific and localized studies requiring a level of detail provided by large-scale map information. The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) defines the areal extent of surface water drainage to a point, accounting for all land and surface areas. Watershed Boundaries are determined solely upon science-based hydrologic principles, not favoring any administrative boundaries or special projects, nor particular program or agency. The intent of defining Hydrologic Units (HU) for the Watershed Boundary Dataset is to establish a baseline drainage boundary framework, accounting for all land and surface areas. At a minimum, the WBD is being delineated and georeferenced to the USGS 1:24,000 scale topographic base map meeting National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). Hydrologic units are given a Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC). For example, a hydrologic region has a 2-digit HUC. A HUC describes where the unit is in the country and the level of the unit. The document &quot;Federal Standards and Procedures for the National Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD)&quot; can be found\\xa0here. ‘A hydrologic unit is a drainage area delineated to nest in a multi-level, hierarchical drainage system. Its boundaries are\\xa0defined by hydrographic and topographic criteria that delineate an area of land upstream from a specific point on a river, stream or similar surface waters. A hydrologic unit can accept surface water directly from upstream drainage areas, and indirectly from associated surface areas such as remnant, non-contributing, and diversions to form a drainage area with single or multiple outlet points. Hydrologic units are only synonymous with classic watersheds when their boundaries include all the source area contributing surface water to a single defined outlet point.’”\\xa0Original metadata.DAC Places 2009-2013:\\xa0Sierra Water Workgroup has modified this layer displaying Disadvantaged Community Places within the Yosemite-Mariposa IRWM Area. Data was provided by the US Census and DWR, and 2013 median household income is displayed in graduated color for analysis. Census Places are identified by Chapter 9 of the US Census Bureau as a\\xa0concentration of population which has a name, is locally recognized, and is not part of any other place. A place typically has a residential nucleus and a closely spaced street pattern, and it frequently includes commercial property and other urban land uses. A place may be\\xa0an\\xa0incorporated place\\xa0(a self-governing city, town, or village) or a census-designated place (CDP).\\xa0Incorporated places are defined by the laws of the states in which they are contained. The Census Bureau delineates CDPs. A small settlement in the open countryside or the densely settled fringe of a large city may not be a place as defined by the Census Bureau. As of the 1990 Census, only 26% of the people in the United States lived outside of places.\\xa0More information.DAC Tracts 2009-2013:\\xa0Sierra Water Workgroup has modified this layer displaying Disadvantaged Community Tracts within the Yosemite-Mariposa IRWM Area. Data was provided by the US Census and DWR, and 2013 median household income is displayed in graduated color for analysis. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.\\xa0More information.DAC Block Groups 2009-2013:\\xa0Sierra Water Workgroup has modified this layer displaying Disadvantaged Community Block Groups within the Yosemite-Mariposa IRWM Area. Data was provided by the US Census and DWR, and 2013 median household income is displayed in graduated color for analysis.\\xa0The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).\\xa0More information.IRWM Boundaries outside Yosemite-Mariposa:\\xa0IRWM boundaries beyond YM IRWM boundary, original layer for state of California provided by DWR.\\xa0Additional\\xa0information.Yosemite-Mariposa IRWM Boundary:\\xa0SWWG created this revised boundary of the Yosemite-Mariposa IRWM Region based on direction from the IRWM.\",\n",

It was derived from the 1:24,000-scale USGS Digital Line Graphs (DLGs).Purpose:These data may be used to construct municipal, regional, or statewide base maps.Supplemental_Information:Data distribution tile: statewideIn ARCE format, the coverage is a combined polygon and line coverage. In shapefile format, the two data types are written separately to PBP (polygon) and PBA (line) shapefiles.This data is not be used as a legal definition of town boundaries in the state.Time_Period_of_Content:Time_Period_Information:Range_of_Dates/Times:Beginning_Date: 19530101Ending_Date: 20130411Currentness_Reference: Publication DateStatus:Progress: CompleteMaintenance_and_Update_Frequency: IrregularSpatial_Domain:Bounding_Coordinates:West_Bounding_Coordinate: -72.5947East_Bounding_Coordinate: -70.6647North_Bounding_Coordinate: 45.3034South_Bounding_Coordinate: 42.6936Keywords:Theme:Theme_Keyword_Thesaurus: NoneTheme_Keyword: BoundaryTheme_Keyword: PoliticalTheme_Keyword: StateTheme_Keyword: CountyTheme_Keyword: TownTheme_Keyword: Digital Line GraphsPlace:Place_Keyword_Thesaurus: NonePlace_Keyword: United StatesPlace_Keyword: NortheastPlace_Keyword: New EnglandPlace_Keyword: New HampshireAccess_Constraints: NoneUse_Constraints: Not for legal usePoint_of_Contact:Contact_Information:Contact_Organization_Primary:Contact_Organization: Complex Systems Research CenterContact_Person: GRANIT Database ManagerContact_Position: GRANIT Database ManagerContact_Address:Address_Type: mailing and physical addressAddress: Morse Hall, University of New HampshireCity: DurhamState_or_Province: NHPostal_Code: 03824Country: USContact_Voice_Telephone: 603-862-1792Contact_Facsimile_Telephone: 603-862-0188Contact_Electronic_Mail_Address: granit@unh.eduHours_of_Service: 8:30AM-5PM, ESTBrowse_Graphic:Browse_Graphic_File_Name:&lt;URL:http://www.granit.sr.unh.edu/cgi-bin/load_file?PATH=/data/database/d-webdata/pb/browse.gif&gt;Browse_Graphic_File_Description: gif image fileBrowse_Graphic_File_Type: gifData_Set_Credit: GRANIT databaseNative_Data_Set_Environment:Arc/Info coverage formatData_Quality_Information:Attribute_Accuracy:Attribute_Accuracy_Report:The primary attribute associated with each polygon is the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which was generated directly from the DLGs.

Line topology was constructed, and attributes were appended using standard Arc/Info utilities. Each tile was then projected from UTM meters (Zone 18 or 19), NAD27, to NH State Plane feet, NAD83. The individual tiles were then edgematched, allowing for movement of arcs at the quadrangle seams of up to 10 ft. to create the statewide layer.Source_Used_Citation_Abbreviation: DLG-3Process_Date: 19920101Source_Produced_Citation_Abbreviation: Version 1Process_Contact:Contact_Information:Contact_Person_Primary:Contact_Organization: Complex Systems Research CenterContact_Person: GRANIT Database ManagerContact_Position: GRANIT Database ManagerContact_Address:Address_Type: mailing and physical addressAddress: Morse Hall, University of New HampshireCity: DurhamState_or_Province: NHPostal_Code: 03824Country: USContact_Voice_Telephone: 603-862-1792Contact_Facsimile_Telephone: 603-862-0188Contact_Electronic_Mail_Address: granit@unh.eduHours_of_Service: 8:30AM-5PM, ESTProcess_Step:Process_Description:The RPA (Regional Planning Agency) designation for 3 towns -

The lands included in PAD-US are assigned\\r\\nconservation measures that qualify their intent to manage lands for the preservation\\r\\nof biological diversity and to other natural, recreational and cultural uses;\\r\\nmanaged for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The\\r\\ngeodatabase includes: 1) Geographic boundaries of public land ownership and\\r\\nvoluntarily provided private conservation lands (e.g., Nature Conservancy\\r\\nPreserves); 2) The combination land owner, land manager, management designation\\r\\nor type, parcel name, GIS Acres and source of geographic information of each\\r\\nmapped land unit 3) GAP Status Code conservation measure of each parcel based\\r\\non USGS National Gap Analysis Program (GAP) protection level categories which\\r\\nprovide a measurement of management intent for long-term biodiversity\\r\\nconservation 4) IUCN category for a protected area's inclusion into UNEP-World\\r\\nConservation Monitoring Centre's World Database for Protected Areas. IUCN\\r\\nprotected areas are defined as, &quot;A clearly defined geographical space,\\r\\nrecognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to\\r\\nachieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services\\r\\nand cultural values&quot; and are categorized following a classification scheme\\r\\navailable through USGS GAP; 5) World Database of Protected Areas (WDPA) Site\\r\\nCodes linking the multiple parcels of a single protected area in PAD-US and\\r\\nconnecting them to the Global Community. \\r\\nPAD-US version 1.2 updates include: 1) National Park Service (NPS) boundaries\\r\\nand GAP Status Code review in cooperation with NPScape and NPS Lands. 2)\\r\\nDepartment of Defense (DOD) boundaries in cooperation with DOD Partners in\\r\\nFlight 3) Official (member and eligible only) Marine Protected Areas as\\r\\naggregated and accepted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\\r\\n(NOAA). 4)The Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) National Landscape Conservation\\r\\nSystem (NLCS) authoritative boundaries in cooperation with NLCS policy\\r\\nrepresentitives and the Lands Division. Note: NLCS National Trails and Wild and\\r\\nScenic Rivers were not updated as they are managed as Line files; however,\\r\\nPADUS already contained many of these protected areas. 5) Modified or newly\\r\\ncreated Wilderness Area boundaries created by The Omnibus Public Lands Act of\\r\\n2009 in cooperation with Wilderness.net. 6) Protected areas in The US Virgin\\r\\nIslands 7) Protected areas in the Pacific Islands (Micronesia) 8) Washington\\r\\nDepartment of Fish and Wildlife protected areas\\r\\n\\r\\nPurpose:\\r\\n\\r\\nPurpose: The mission of the USGS Gap Analysis Program (GAP)\\r\\nis to provide state, regional and national assessments of the conservation\\r\\nstatus of native vertebrate species and natural land cover types and to\\r\\nfacilitate the application of this information to land management activities.\\r\\nThe PAD-US geodatabase is required to organize and assess the management status\\r\\n(i.e. apply GAP Status Codes) of elements of biodiversity protection. The goal\\r\\nof GAP is to keep common species common by identifying species and plant\\r\\ncommunities not adequately represented in existing conservation lands. Common\\r\\nspecies are those not currently threatened with extinction. By identifying\\r\\ntheir habitats, Gap Analysis gives land managers and policy makers the\\r\\ninformation they need to make better-informed decisions when identifying\\r\\npriority areas for conservation. In cooperation with UNEP-World Conservation\\r\\nMonitoring Centre, GAP ensures PAD-US also supports global analyses and policy\\r\\ndecisions by maintaining World Database for Protected Areas (WDPA) Site Codes\\r\\nand data for International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)\\r\\ncategorized protected areas in the United States. The USGS National Gap Analysis\\r\\nProgram (GAP) aggregated the Protected Areas Database of the United States\\r\\nversion 1.1 (PAD-US v1.1) with significant contributions from the Bureau of\\r\\nLand Management, The US Forest Service, GreenInfo Network, Applied Geographics\\r\\nand The Nature Conservancy, who provided a spatial dataset of public and\\r\\nprivate lands and waters secured by a conservation situation that includes an\\r\\nexplicit level of security from future conversion and current incompatible\\r\\nuses. These are spatial data from TNC's Conservation Lands System (CLS)\\r\\ndatabase, which is the legal database of record for all TNC land transactions\\r\\n(fee, easement, lease and deed restrictions). GAP seeks to increase the\\r\\nefficiency and accuracy of PAD-US updates by leveraging resources in protected\\r\\nareas data aggregation and maintenance as described in &quot;A Map of the\\r\\nFuture&quot;, published following the PAD-US Design Project (July, 2009)\\r\\navailable from: www.protectedlands.net.\\r\\n\\r\\nTime_Period_of_Content:\\r\\n\\r\\nTime_Period_Information:\\r\\n\\r\\nRange_of_Dates/Times:\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning_Date:\\r\\n2005\\r\\n\\r\\nEnding_Date:\\r\\n2011\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrentness_Reference:\\r\\npublication date\\r\\n\\r\\nStatus:\\r\\n\\r\\nProgress:\\r\\nComplete\\r\\n\\r\\nMaintenance_and_Update_Frequency: Annually\\r\\n\\r\\nSpatial_Domain:\\r\\n\\r\\nBounding_Coordinates:\\r\\n\\r\\nWest_Bounding_Coordinate:\\r\\n-180.000000\\r\\n\\r\\nEast_Bounding_Coordinate:\\r\\n180.000000\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth_Bounding_Coordinate:\\r\\n90.000000\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth_Bounding_Coordinate:\\r\\n-41.370653\\r\\n\\r\\nKeywords:\\r\\n\\r\\nTheme:\\r\\n\\r\\nTheme_Keyword:\\r\\nProtected Area\\r\\n\\r\\nTheme_Keyword:\\r\\nLand Manager\\r\\n\\r\\nTheme_Keyword:\\r\\nGAP Status Code\\r\\n\\r\\nTheme_Keyword:\\r\\nLand Stewardship\\r\\n\\r\\nTheme_Keyword:\\r\\nLand Ownership\\r\\n\\r\\nTheme_Keyword:\\r\\nGap Analysis\\r\\n\\r\\nTheme_Keyword:\\r\\nBiodiversity\\r\\n\\r\\nTheme_Keyword:\\r\\nConservation\\r\\n\\r\\nTheme_Keyword:\\r\\nProtection Status\\r\\n\\r\\nTheme_Keyword:IUCN\\r\\nCategory\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace:\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nUnited States\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nAlabama (AL)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nAlaska (AK)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nArizona (AZ)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nArkansas (AR)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nCalifornia (CA)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nColorado (CO)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nConnecticut (CT)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nDelaware (DE)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nFlorida (FL)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nGeorgia (GA)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nHawaii (HI)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nIdaho (ID)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nIllinois (IL)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nIndiana (IN)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nIowa (IA)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nKansas (KS)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nKentucky (KY)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nLouisiana (LA)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nMaine (ME)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nMaryland (MD)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nMassachusetts (MA)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nMichigan (MI)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nMinnesota (MN)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nMississippi (MS)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nMissouri (MO)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace_Keyword:\\r\\nMontana (MT)\\r\\n\\r\\n<span sty\",\n",

(AIS) to perform a 2015 Land Use Update (aka Phase 1, Product 1, P1) and to create a 2015 Enhanced Land Use Update (aka Phase 2, Product 2, P2) data set for the nine-county DVRPC region consisting of Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia counties in Pennsylvania, and Camden, Burlington, Gloucester, and Mercer counties in New Jersey. The project started in February 2016 and completed in April 2017. AIS used computer interactive photo interpretation and heads-up digitizing to create both land use datasets. The project was performed in two phases.This metadata is for the Enhanced Land Use (P2) mapping effort.The P2 layer was the creation of an enhanced land use layer using a more detailed land use classification and standardized data capture criteria, including minimum mapping size guidelines for built-up land use types and parking lots. The P2 layer will support DVRPC’s more detailed planning analyses goals and other programs and projects at DVRPC and their member governments and agencies.Despite some overlap in the land use classification and data capture criteria for each effort, the P1 and P2 geodatabases do not completely correlate to one another due to the more detailed P2 classification, changes in the categorization of some land use features from P1 to P2 and revisions to the original DVRPC data capture criteria.All work was performed by AIS staff, at the AIS office in Redlands, California using Esri ArcGIS 10.3 software capabilities. No sub-contractors or outside consultants were used throughout the performance of the contract.[2.0] Enhanced Land Use Update (P2)[2.1] Adjust Parcels to County BoundariesThe first task of the Enhanced Land Use Update was to adjust the individual county parcel datasets to the DVRPC regional county boundary file to ensure there were no gaps or overlaps in the parcel data along county boundaries. Parcel boundaries along the county edge were extended and/or “clipped” to the regional county boundaries, thereby removing gaps and/or overlaps in the parcel data. The parcel boundaries were not otherwise adjusted.[2.2] Fast-Track MappingUpon completion of the P1 mapping effort, a fast-track mapping effort was performed in Camden County, NJ to test the data capture criteria and assumptions developed for the P2 Enhanced mapping. Issues identified during this process were discussed and resolved in consultation with DVRPC through a series of conference call “webinars”. The process helped to resolve major criteria issues at an early stage of the project, thereby facilitating the consistent data capture and uninterrupted workflow of the P2 production mapping.[2.3] Enhanced Land Use Data Creation (P2)The 2015 P1 Land Use Update and the 2015 DVRPC imagery were used as the baseline for the Enhanced Land Use interpretations, using the same working production module grid developed for the P1 mapping process. The same computer interactive heads-up digitizing techniques used to capture the P1 data were used for the P2 mapping but the information was captured per the more detailed land use categories described in attached documentation and the P2 criteria described in this document.The interpreters reviewed the newly created 2015 P1 land use layer against the 2015 digital imagery and revised the data to 2015 conditions following the more detailed P2 land use classification and minimum mapping unit guidelines. Polygon boundaries and/or attributes were modified accordingly, regardless of whether it was a subdivision of the P1 data to reflect the more detailed classification and mapping criteria, or a revision to correct legacy coding/boundary errors retained in the data from previous land use inventories.The Enhanced Land Use delineations and codes were edgematched to adjacent production modules and across county boundaries, as applicable, to ensure the continuity of information across boundaries.[3.0] Quality Control ReviewTo ensure the accuracy and completeness of the interpretations for both the 2015 Land Use (P1) Update and the Enhanced Land Use (P2), a comprehensive quality control (QC) review was performed to ensure the land use delineations and codes adhered to the project criteria and classification for both the P1 and P2 mapping efforts.Senior AIS staff members reviewed the updated and enhanced land use features to verify the accuracy and consistency among interpreters, looking for completeness, uncoded polygons, unnecessary boundaries, and how well the delineations match the imagery. The edgematch to adjoining completed modules was also reviewed and any discrepancies along the edges were resolved. In addition, automated final checks for topology errors and invalid codes were also conducted once the production modules were joined together. One last quality control review was conducted on the completed geodatabases prior to the draft and final deliveries to ensure that the database was seamless and was processed correctly.[4.0] Map ValidationIn addition to the Quality Control task, a series of map validation procedures were performed to ensure the accuracy of the 2015 Land Use data and the Enhanced Land Use mapping per the P1 and P2 project classifications and mapping criteria. The validation process consisted of on-line virtual field surveys using internet resources such as Google Maps, Bing Maps, Google Earth, and other websites; review of multiple image sets representing different eras; correlation to county parcel data; and DVRPC staff comments arising from AIS questions and the DVRPC review of the data.[4.1] Ancillary Digital ImageryIn addition to the 2015 base imagery, the interpreters referred to the 2010 natural color digital ortho-rectified imagery provided by DVRPC and online imagery available through Google Maps, Google Earth and Bing Maps. The ancillary imagery provided the interpreters with a more comprehensive picture of the land use by providing them with views of the study area under different seasonal conditions, in different eras. The interpreters used this information to make more accurate informed decisions about the pattern of land use and types of land use change for a given area.[4.2] Virtual Field Checks (Internet Resources)The internet proved to be a significant resource of information for the 2015 Update and was used to perform “virtual” field checks for both the P1 and P2 land use interpretations. The amount and quality of online information obtained by this virtual field survey method was particularly valuable for the more detailed P2 mapping effort due to the level of classification detail and the ¼-acre minimum mapping unit for built-up land use types. The Google Maps and Bing Maps Street View images, where available, often allowed the interpreter to read building signs and other information, to help identify the land use type. Google Maps was also an excellent resource for built-up (urban) land use types as it provided the names and point locations of private and public entities, often with additional links to associated websites.Google Earth provided the same advantages that Google Maps did, but in addition, it also had multiple sets of imagery spanning different timeframes, which enabled the interpreter to get a historical perspective of an area. The imagery from multiple eras was advantageous when historical knowledge of an area helped make coding decisions. This was primarily useful when evaluating change in transitional areas, particularly when trying to determine the status of agricultural land.Bing Maps was primarily used by the interpreters for the Bird’s Eye and Street View images, where available. The Bird’s Eye imagery provided the interpreters with a close-up view of the area in question, sometimes at multiple oblique angles, in order to see more clearly areas of change, determine property boundaries, and even the relative height of vegetation when these features were not clearly visible on the project imagery. Bing Maps also provided land use information but not to the same degree as Google Maps.The Google search engine was frequently used by interpreters to further research the information obtained from Google Maps and Bing Maps, in order to more accurately classify the land use type.[4.3] Digital County Parcel DataThe county parcel data provided varying levels of land use information depending on the level of parcel land use detail and how closely the parcel land use classes matched the P1 and P2 land use class descriptions. The interpreters used the information to corroborate the land use attributes for the P1 and P2 data, accordingly.[4.4] Digital USGS Raster DataOpen source USGS raster data (DRGs) was another resource used to increase the accuracy of the interpretations. Due to the age of the DRG information, they were used primarily to verify the general topography and to get a historic perspective of the vegetation and land use for a given area.[4.5] DVRPC Interactive Teleconference, Data Review and CommentAdditional validation steps of the land use assignment were performed through consultation with DVRPC staff over the course of the project, particularly for the P2 mapping effort. AIS created bookmarks in the data identifying issues requiring further discussion and resolution with DVRPC staff. These issues were reviewed during a series of teleconference webinars using the JoinMe computer program that allowed for the sharing of computer screens in real time. This process was immensely helpful in furthering the development of the mapping criteria and classification descriptions for the P2 mapping effort. The issues/questions were documented and the meeting notes delivered to DVRPC for their internal documentation. In some instances, the resolution coming from DVRPC resulted in global changes to the criteria. In other situations, the issues were localized, only affecting a limited number of features. In both examples, the input from DVRPC increased the accuracy and provided validation of the land use types in question.[5.0] DVRPC ReviewUpon completion of the mapping for each county, the draft datasets were submitted to DVRPC for their review and acceptance, for both the P1 and P2 mapping efforts. The DVPRC review comments, if any, were re-delivered to AIS for revision, and if necessary, further comment. Upon completion of this process, the final data set was delivered to DVRPC.[6.0] General Representation of Land Use Features[6.1] When a road separated differing land use features, the polygons for these features followed the perceived road centerline. Although roads often include a right-of-way on either side, these slivers of land between the roads and the adjacent land use features were aggregated with the land use unless they could be reasonably extracted. The above criteria were applied for the delineation of new land use polygons. Existing land use polygon boundaries that fell within the road right-of-way but did not follow road centerlines due to image registration issues were not corrected.[6.2] Where roads and features on the orthophoto differed from those represented on other collateral sources, the location on the orthophoto was used to depict the feature.[6.3] Boundaries were followed as closely as possible. Where boundaries were particularly jagged, however, some cartographic smoothing was deemed appropriate. This was generally for use along natural boundaries and was rarely needed along “man-made” boundaries.[6.4] Built-up land uses usually follow “man-made” features such as fence lines, roads, and property boundaries. Boundaries were typically drawn with straight lines and right angle corners were used; lines were placed down the centerline of boundaries (such as roads and tree lines).[6.5] Buildings housing different land use types were typically not split. Where different land use types are connected to one another (share a common wall), the building was typically delineated as a single feature and assigned the appropriate land use type. Covered walkways that connected buildings also allowed the buildings to be captured as a single feature (examples include Regional & Community Retail Centers). Where there were gaps between buildings (they do not share a common wall), the buildings were assessed individually. This criterion applied to all land use types. Exceptions are noted in the classification description.[6.6] Commercial Shopping Developments (P2 only) code assignments were based on the building configuration, not the general development of the area. For example, where both stand-alone and connected buildings are on a single property, they will be captured independently of one another, assuming each meets the project minimum mapping unit of ¼ acre.[6.7] Abandoned built-up land use will be coded as the last known use if the buildings appear in reasonably good order. If the buildings have been demolished, or have deteriorated to the point where they cannot be used “as is” (i.e. they should be demolished), the feature will be coded as Undeveloped (14000).[6.8] Natural vegetation boundaries tend to be transitional therefore the line separating different classes was often less distinct. These polygons seldom contained straight edges or angles unless the vegetation unit was adjacent to built-up or “man-made” features. Vegetation category polygons were usually represented with flowing and curvilinear lines, reflecting the more natural shape of the land cover.[7.0] Minimum Mapping Units (MMU)[7.1] Quarter-acre (¼ acre) = built-up land use, Agriculture, Water, and Undeveloped in urban areas.[7.2] Two (2) acre = Single Family Residential in non-urban areas, Undeveloped in non-urban areas, and Wooded.[7.3] Sixty foot (60’) minimum width for water and other linear features excluding Highway ROW and Rail ROW.[7.4] Highway ROW = Divided highway (as shown on Google Maps) and where they are One-hundred feet (100’) wide. Existing ROW that do not meet this criteria are grandfathered in.[7.5] Rail ROW = Three (3) Rail lines within ROW. Existing ROW that do not meet this criteria are grandfathered in.[7.6] No minimum size for “remnant” built-up land uses. Remnant land uses are below resolution features created by the subdivision of their original boundaries due to land use, criteria changes, or street casing splits.[7.7] Parking lots with ten (10) parking spaces or more.[8.0] Below-MMU polygons[8.1] Below resolution polygons were left intact or created in the following situations: Below resolution land use features were mapped provided they were significant to the overall classification of the area. Typically, this occurred where the land use type was present within a given area but no single feature attained the minimum mapping size. If the MMU had been strictly observed, these units would not have been captured in the database. By mapping certain land use classes smaller than the MMU, the user is given a more accurate depiction of land use conditions in these areas.[8.2] Remnant polygons from the 2010 Update were kept in the data as long as they were significant to the overall classification of the area. Typically, these included built-up land uses and wetland vegetation types. Upland vegetation remnants were usually re-classified into surrounding land use polygons.[9.0] Land Use AggregationWhere a non-exempted class did not meet the minimum mapping unit size, it was aggregated into an adjacent land use type per the following general guidelines:[9.1] Built-up land uses took precedence over non built-up categories. For example, if a below-MMU residential land use was adjacent to a below-MMU forest cover, the forested area was typically absorbed into the residential land use.[9.2] In general, residential land uses took precedence over other built-up land uses. If a below-MMU residential land use was adjacent to a below-MMU commercial land use, typically the commercial area was absorbed into the residential land use.[9.3] If a below-MMU land use feature was surrounded by a number of other above-MMU land use features, then the below-MMU unit would be absorbed into the unit that most closely represented its class. For example, if a below-MMU residential class was next to above-MMU commercial, industrial, and forested polygons, the residential land use was absorbed into the commercial polygon.[9.4] An isolated below-MMU land use feature completely surrounded by a single land use feature was absorbed into the surrounding land use class.[9.5] Some remnant polygons remaining from the 2010 Update were merged according to the criteria above if they were not significant to the overall classification of the area.[10.0] Order of Precedence[10.1] Roads take precedence over Railroads, Utility, and Water.[10.2] Railroads take precedence over Utility and Water.[10.3] Water takes precedence over Utility.[10.4] Transitional Land takes precedence over Utility: Right-of-Way.[10.5] Residential backyards (developed) and areas of equipment/material storage associated with industrial/commercial uses take precedence over Utility: Right-of-Way.[10.6] Utility: Right-of-Way takes precedence over Agriculture, Undeveloped, and Wooded.[10.7] Drainage Basins take precedence over Highway ROW and Utility ROW.[11.0] Parking Lot Criteria[11.1] Minimum mapping size = ten (10) parking spaces.[11.2] Includes parking areas designated for residents, visitors (shoppers), and employees.[11.3] Does not include parking for company vehicles, such as police, fire, and utility yards, bus yards, trucking companies, industrial truck parking.[11.4] Does not include undesignated or “opportunistic” parking areas such as vacant lots that function as informal parking for an area.[11.5] Parking lots can be paved or unpaved (gravel).[11.6] Unpaved lots should have some kind of parking infrastructure visible on the photos, such as light standards or other indications that the lot is used for parking. Where the infrastructure is not visible and no clearly defined parking relationship can be established with the adjacent land use, the gravel lots will be coded as vacant.[11.7] Where a single parking lot serves multiple land use types, the parking lot will be delineated based on visible boundaries, e.g. walls, landscaping, changes in pavement, roads, etc., that can be correlated to the individual land use types. Where these boundaries are not present, an arbitrary boundary will be drawn based on a “reasonable” division of the parking area and proximity to the associated land use. Where a “reasonable” division cannot be made, the parking lot will be captured as a single feature and assigned the most appropriate land use code.[11.8] Where buildings have been demolished but the associated parking lot remains, the new code, Parking: Undetermined Use (14009) will be applied.[11.9] Former parking lots that have deteriorated to the point of being not viable for parking (asphalt removed, very weedy, etc.) will be captured as Undeveloped (14000) in P2.[11.10] Parking lots for model homes are captured as Parking: Commercial/Parking: Commercial Other (06009).[11.11] Parking lots that cannot be correlated to a specific land use will be captured as Parking: Undetermined Use (14009).[11.12] The entire parking area of abandoned car lots is captured as Parking: Commercial Other (06009). This includes the new car parking areas previously coded as Commercial. The abandoned sales offices and service garages will remain Commercial, per the abandoned land use mapping criteria.[11.13] Parking lots owned/operated by government (municipal, county, state) parking authorities are captured as Parking: Institutional Other (07009), if the lots are not clearly associated with other non-institutional use; ownership will direct the code attribution. If the lots are linked to non-institutional land uses, the parking will be captured for the use; the use will take precedence over ownership.[11.14] Freestanding garages in multi-family residential developments are captured as Parking: Residential Multi-Family (01019), not as Residential: Multi-Family.[11.15] Multi-story parking structures where the ground floor contains other uses are captured as Parking for the associated use, not the ground floor use.[11.16] Does not include “head-in” street parking.[11.17] Does not include temporary parking lots associated with construction sites.[11.18] A parking garage in Philadelphia has the following features: it serves both an office tower and apartments, and it has an urban park on the roof. It is best captured as Parking: Office (06059).[11.19] If landscaping is located between the parking and the street, with no buildings in between, the landscaping will be included with the parking. Where there are large areas of landscaping (one acre or more), an exception can be made, and the area captured as the associated use.[11.20] If the landscaping is located between the building and the street, the landscaping will be included with the use.[11.21] If the landscaping is located adjacent to the street, building(s), and parking, the landscaping will typically be captured with the associated use; it will not be subdivided at the point where it is adjacent to the parking area.Fieldslu15cat: Land use main category two-digit code.lu15catn: Land use main category name.lu15catlu15catnArcGIS color01ResidentialSolar Yellow (RGB: 255 255 0)03IndustrialLilac Dust (RGB: 194 158 215)04TransportationGray 60% (RGB: 104 104 104)05UtilityRose Quartz (RGB: 255 190 190)06CommercialMars Red (RGB: 255 0 0)07InstitutionalSodalite Blue (RGB: 190 232 255)08MilitaryDelft Blue (RGB: 0 132 168)09RecreationCitroen Yellow (RGB: 230 230 0)10AgricultureLime Dust (RGB: 215 215 158)11MiningTuscan Red (RGB: 168 0 0)12WoodedQuetzel Green (RGB: 76 230 0)13WaterBig Sky Blue (RGB: 0 197 255)14UndevelopedMedium Key Lime (RGB: 165 245 122)lu15sub: Land use subcategory five-digit code.lu15subn: Land use subcategory name.lu15dev: Development status.luP1cat: Equivalent land use category codes employed during 2015 P1 land use delineation (and all previous land use work - 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010), prior to the creation of the 2015 enhanced (P2) land use categories.luP1catn: Equivalent land use categories employed during 2015 P1 land use delineation (and all previous land use work - 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010), prior to the creation of the 2015 enhanced (P2) land use categories.',\n",

       "  'dc_description_s': 'Napa County has used a 2004 edition vegetation map produced using the Manual of California Vegetation classification system (Thorne et al. 2004) as one of the input layers for land use decision and policy. The county decided to update the map because of its utility. A University of California, Davis (UCD) group was engaged to produce the map. The earlier map used black and white digital orthophoto quadrangles from 1993, with a pixel resolution of 3 meters. This image was delineated using a heads up digitization technique produced by ASI (Aerial Services Incorporated). The resulting polygons were the provided vegetation and landcover attributes following the classification system used by California State Department of Fish and Wildlife mappers in the Manual of California Vegetation. That effort included a brief field campaign in which surveyors drove accessible roads and verified or corrected the dominant vegetation of polygons adjacent to roadways or visible using binoculars. There were no field relevé or rapid assessment plots conducted. This update version uses a 2016 edition of 1 meter color aerial imagery taken by the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) as the base imagery. In consultation with the county we decided to use similar methods to the previous mapping effort, in order to preserve the capacity to assess change in the county over time. This meant forgoing recent data and innovations in remote sensing such as the use LiDAR and Ecognition’s segmentation of imagery to delineate stands, which have been recently used in a concurrent project mapping of Sonoma County. The use of such technologies would have made it more difficult to track changes in landcover, because differences between publication dates would not be definitively attributable to either actual land cover change or to change in methodology. The overall cost of updating the map in the way was approximately 20% of the cost of the Sonoma vegetation mapping program.Therefore, we started with the original map, and on-screen inspections of the 2004 polygons to determine if change had occurred. If so, the boundaries and attributes were modified in this new edition of the map. We also used the time series of imagery available on Google Earth, to further inspect many edited polygons. While funding was not available to do field assessments, we incorporated field expertise and other map data from four projects that overlap with parts of Napa Count: the Angwin Experimental Forest; a 2014 vegetation map of the Knoxville area; agricultural rock piles were identified by Amber Manfree; and parts of a Sonoma Vegetation Map that used 2013 imagery.The Angwin Experimental Forest was mapped by Peter Lecourt from Pacific Union College. He identified several polygons of redwoods in what are potentially the eastern-most extent of that species. We reviewed those polygons with him and incorporated some of the data from his area into this map.The 2014 Knoxville Vegetation map was developed by California Department of Fish and Wildlife. It was made public in February of 2019, close to the end of this project. We reviewed the map, which covers part of the northeast portion of Napa County. We incorporated polygons and vegetation types for 18 vegetation types including the rare ones, we reviewed and incorporated some data for another 6 types, and we noted in comments the presence of another 5 types. There is a separate report specifically addressing the incorporation of this map to our map.Dr Amber Manfree has been conducting research on fire return intervals for parts of Napa County. In her research she identified that large piles of rocks are created when vineyards are put in. These are mapable features. She shared the locations of rock piles she identified, which we incorporated into the map. The Sonoma Vegetation Map mapped some distance into the western side of Napa County. We reviewed that map’s polygons for coast redwood. We then examined our imagery and the Google imagery to see if we could discern the whorled pattern of tree branches. Where we could, we amended or expanded redwood polygons in our map.The Vegetation classification systems used here follows California’s Manual of California Vegetation and the National Vegetation Classification System (MCV and NVCS). We started with the vegetation types listed in the 2004 map. We predominantly use the same set of species names, with modifications/additions particularly from the Knoxville map. The NVCS uses Alliance and Association as the two most taxonomically detailed levels. This map uses those levels. It also refers to vegetation types that have not been sampled in the field and that has 3-6 species and a site descriptor as Groups, which is the next more general level in the NVCS classification. We conducted 3 rounds of quality assessment/quality control exercises. ',\n",

The data is available in the form of CD-ROM, DVD, hardcopy, and on-line access. The Office of the Assessor also offers a GIS Tax Parcel Base Map.Some layers included (not an exhaustive list):parcel boundary map (shapefile format)local rollLA County wall mappublicly owned parcelssales listunsecured rolland labels (for mailings)A discussion of parcel accuracyOccasionally questions about the spatial accuracy of parcel information come up. In general, it is important to note that the parcels are for tax assessment purposes only, come from many sources, some historical, and are not necessarily survey grade. That said, they are in general extremely reliable.Here is a longer description from Emilio Solano, head of the Assessor Mapping and GIS Services:The very short answer is this: our data is in its majority accurate within a couple of feet, in other cases will not be so accurate.The issue of accuracy when applied to assessor’s data is very subjective. Our data is very accurate if we consider that all the information matches recorded information, we try our best to keep recent data as it was recorded, and older data gets slightly adjusted to match the most recent data. Another factor to consider is that about one third of the total number of new parcels created every year comes from deeds, not subdivision maps, that is, there is not, in the majority of the cases, any new survey data, more likely general descriptions of where the new boundaries should exist, or references to adjacent properties, even calls to documents recorded many years ago, referring to them just by the document number. In those cases we have to consider the intent of the owner when describing the property in the deed.Another couple of factors that have an impact in the accuracy of our data comes from the fact that we assembled this vast amount of information with digital data provided from at least a dozen of cities, Los Angeles, Long Beach, Torrance, etc. plus all the data gathered by LACO DPW in CAD format. We had to compile all that data, rectify it and adjusted as needed, always keeping in mind that the integrity of the data should be maintained by matching RECORDED information. Another factor is that the data was also coming from tens of thousands of individual recordings, it wasn’t as clean cut as when you look at a single subdivision, no matter how big, where every line is clearly identified by a bearing and a distance within a perfectly traced boundary. Our original data sources even go back as far as remainder pieces of land described by Spanish grants and ranchos, section land plus newer surveys.Even though we always input our data based on survey records using COGO tools, whenever possible, a lot of the data is not. Considering all that, our GIS layer is by far, the most accurate data set of its size available anywhere in the county, both in positional accuracy, and conformity to the information provided by legal sources.All that being said, the resulting fact is that, as mark mentioned, in some areas our data will be very accurate, in others it won’t. The most important thing to keep in mind is that given that our responsibility is to reflect property information as recorded, we do not use anything else as a guide, for example we never use an aerial image to change the position of a line just because it doesn’t fall on top of a fence shown on a photo; remember that many people build their fenced, especially the ones made out of concrete blocks, a couple of inches inside the property boundary because is difficult to dig a trench along an existing wooden or wire fence, now multiply those little variances spread out over a 4000+ square miles of land and you will get a picture of what we are up to.That’s why we continually try to stress in anybody using our data that, if they need total accuracy they will need to hire a surveyor to get it. Our 11 by 17 maps are our only official source of information and should only be used for assessment purposes, or in the case of other uses, just for information, to get an accurate idea of how close to the real location a line could be.',\n",

(1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of &quot;farmed wetlands&quot; as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition.

This layer depicts montane meadow vegetation on National Forests in the Sierra Nevada range. Meadows are wet and dry grassland types and short emergent meadow types maintained by man-made dams. Vegetation consists of a mixture of grasses, perennial herbs, rushes, and sedges. Woody vegetation is typically associated with riparian meadows. Riparian vegetation can be shrub or tree form, such as willow, alder, cottonwood, and aspen types. Meadow types are coded as wet or dry, with or without woody vegetation, or short emergent wetland. \\xa0Meadow polygons are mapped to a minimum of 5 acres. California Vegetation (CALVEG) types within a meadow polygon are mapped to a minimum of 2.5 acres.Data published: 2001Updated: November 8, 2006.\\xa0Original Metadata.Meadow Management Zones:\\xa0Sierra Water Workgroup has created this layer depicting meadow management zones within the Yosemite-Mariposa IRWM region.

Each meadow buffer area is coded on the constraint to timber management activities.\\xa0Original metadata.National Inventoried Roadless Areas:\\xa0Sierra Water Workgroup has created this layer outlining National Forest Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRAs) within the Yosemite-Mariposa IRWM region. Data was provided by the USDA Forest Service.\\xa0It is a subset of &quot;ira_us_dd&quot;, the dataset containing all National Forest Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRAs) for the lower 48 states, including Puerto Rico, to which this metadata document refers.\\xa0The IRA data was originally submitted to GSTC by all national forests through their Regional Offices for the Forest Service's Roadless Area Conservation Initiative. The data was consolidated at the GSTC and used in the Draft Environment Impact Statement. \\xa0Between the draft and final stages of the Environmental Impact Statement, the data was updated by the forests to reflect any corrections to Inventoried Roadless Areas that were based on existing forest plans and administrative record. The data was also supplemented to include Special Designated Area information and to include Inventoried Roadless Areas within Special Designated Areas. \\xa0The data was resubmitted to the GSTC on July 21, 2000 for consolidation and the completed coverage was used in the Roadless Area Conservation Final Environmental Impact Statement. \\xa0On October 15, 2002, the Gallatin National Forest submitted a technical correction to the Inventoried Roadless Area GISdatabase. \\xa0A portion of the original GIS data was corrected to match the 1999 IRA maps that are part of the forest administrative record.\\xa0IRAs are based on completed forestplans, forest plans in revision where the agency has established an inventory (this information should be available in Appendix C of most forest plans), or other assessments that are completed and adopted by the agency. \\xa0RARE II information was used in cases where a forest does not have a more current roadless inventory, which was established using RARE II information.\\xa0The purpose of this spatial dataset is to show where the Inventoried Roadless Areas are located. \\xa0The EIS analysis team used this spatial data to assess the impacts of roadless area alternatives on Forest Service policies,use of the National Forests and the surrounding environment. \\xa0It was used for analysis in combination with national characterization layers, such as ambient human population, forest mortality risk to insects and diseases, current land cover types, and others. \\xa0All of these datasets include the entire lower 48 states, and are coarse resolution. \\xa0The public also had a need to know where IRAs were located in their area and across the nation. \\xa0The data was used to create a set of detailed maps published both on the web and in hardcopy form, (Volume2, Roadless Area Conservation EIS).\\xa0Original metadata.Data published: July 9, 2009Riparian Conservation Areas: Conservation Prescription:\\xa0Sierra Water Workgroup has produced this layer displaying Riparian Conservation Areas within the Yosemite-Mariposa IRWM region.\\xa0Riparian conservation areas are land allocations that are managed to maintain or restore the structure and function of aquatic, riparian and meadow ecosystems. The intent of management direction for RCAs is to (1) preserve, enhance, and restore habitat for riparian- and aquatic-dependent species; (2) ensure that water quality is maintained or restored; (3) enhance habitat conservation for species associated with the transition zone between upslope and riparian areas; and (4) provide greater connectivity within the watershed.Riparian conservation areas are land allocations that are managed to maintain or restore the structure and function of aquatic, riparian and meadow ecosystems.

This data was developed by the USDA Forest Service for use in the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment Environmental Impact Statement.\\xa0Original metadata.One of the key decisions in the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment relates to impacts from fuels treatments in the urban wildland intermix zone on California spotted owl habitat. The Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and key owl scientists reached consensus on the amount and intensity of fuels treatment in this zone. In addition, this zone has highest priority for fuel treatments. Based on the mapped allocations and projected treatment schedules developed for the decision, fuel activities will be focused in urban wildland intermix zones and Herger-Feinstein Quincy Library Group (HFQLG) pilot project defensible fuels profile zones (DFPZs). Out-year fuels treatment funding depends on having accurate data regarding locations, amount, potential conflicts, and types of treatments planned for these areas in the next few years. The location of urban areas is the cornerstone for defining the largest portion of acres treated.Data Published: December 2006Wildland Urban Intermix: Source Agency:\\xa0Sierra Water Workgroup has created this layer depicting polygon features of urban intermix zones. \\xa0This zone (WUI) is an area where human habitation is mixed with areas of flammable wildland vegetation. \\xa0It extends out from the edge of developed private land into Federal, private, and State jurisdictions.\\xa0WUI Threat allows users to prioritize areas of risk to life and property from fire, and as such delineate areas and treatment strategies to lower that risk. \\xa0It may serve as a fundamental land attribute for assigning regional and statewide policy for land use and fire management policy.\\xa0This data was developed by the USDA Forest Service for use in the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment Environmental Impact Statement.\\xa0Original metadata.These data describe relative risk to areas of significant population density from wildfire by intersecting residential housing unit density with proximate fire threat to give a relative measure of potential loss of structures and threats to public safety from wildfire. \\xa0These data are consistent with general \\xa0National Fire Plan ideals, but is more refined both in terms of mapping extent and in terms of quantification of risk. \\xa0Within California, both wildfire risk and asset characteristics can vary in the same area. \\xa0To account for these multiple combinations, spatial data is used to distinguish fire-related characteristics from assets, and spatial rules are applied for determining relative risk of loss\\xa0(see the Assessment document Assessment Information Systems\\xa0http://www.frap.cdf.ca.gov/_assessment/Introductory_Materials/infosystems.html).Data Published: December 2006Sierra Fisher Conservation Areas: Forest Prescription:\\xa0Sierra Water Workgroup has created this layer depicting Southern Sierra Fisher Conservation Areas within the Yosemite-Mariposa IRWM region.

This administered land is coincident with the Forest Plan boundary, and often includes portions of one to three Proclaimed National Forests as well as other administered lands and purchase units.\\xa0Planning Units are used as the primary inventory expansion acres for sample strata populations for both non-forest, and forest type conditions within an Administered National Forest, i.e., the lands publicly owned and administered by an individual National Forest Supervisor's Office.\\xa0Original metadata.Data Published: February 2009Wildfire Direct Protection Areas:\\xa0Sierra Water Workgroup has created this layer delineating between lands within the Yosemite-Mariposa IRWM region which are provided wildland fire protection by the State, Federal, and Local agencies. Data was provided by the USDA Forest Service.\\xa0Original metadata.The Cooperative Fire Management Agreement (CFMA) between the federal agencies and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) is the primary mechanism that provides the framework for wildland fire protection responsibilities statewide. Through this mechanism the state has been divided into practical Direct Protection Areas (DPAs) corresponding with each agency's responsibility. The participating agencies submit proposal for changes to their DPA where necessary.\\xa0This layer has been developed to assist in the process of State and Federal agencies jointly developing their &quot;Operating Plans&quot; which document the location of the DPA boundaries for each agency as identified in the CALIFORNIA MASTER COOPERATIVE WILDLAND FIRE MANAGEMENT AND STAFFORD ACT RESPONSE AGREEMENT (CFMA).R5 FS Agreement No. 08-FI-11052012-110NPS Agreement No. H8075070103CA BLM Agreement No. BAA081001FWS Agreement No. 80233-7-J004 \\xa0BIA Agreement No. AGP000751CAL FIRE Agreement No. 7CA000245Data published: May 11, 2015National Forest Land Management Plan Emphasis Areas:\\xa0Sierra Water Workgroup has created this layer consisting of Land and Resource Management Plan areas identified as Management Areas. Some Forest plans have assigned management area names to the polygons, some have assigned management area emphasis, some have assigned both. Data was provided by the USDA Forest Service.\\xa0Original metadata.Data Published: September 24, 2007Water Districts:\\xa0Sierra Water Workgroup has produced this layer displaying Private Water District boundaries in the Yosemite-Mariposa Watershed Region.\\xa0Data was sourced from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, MPGIS Service Center in coordination with the California Department of Water Resources.\\xa0The Private Water District boundaries database is cooperatively shared between the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), Mid-Pacific regional office (MP), MPGIS Service Center and the California Department of Water Resources (DWR). The USBR maintains this database with the voluntary assistance of the Private Water Districts.\\xa0Original metadata.Private Water District boundaries are areas where private contracts provide water to the district in California. This database is designed as a regions polygon database and is updated when sufficient number of changes have occured to warrant an update. Updates are determined by the needs of the local office. Separate databases are used for maintenance purposes. Boundaries are continually being updated as changes are identified by the Water Districts. The boundaries are not current for all Water Districts found in the database at the same time due to the update methods employed. There may be conflicts in the boundaries between districts due to the time of update and review process associated with each Water District. Other problems may be associated with Water District name changes that have not been updated and possibly new Water Districts not being included due to lack of information. This database represents the most current and accurate understanding of the boundary location and current name of the Water Districts.Publication Date: March 2003Groundwater Units:\\xa0Sierra Water Workgroup has created this layer depicting ground water units in the Yosemite-Mariposa IRWM region. Data was provided by USGS.The California Groundwater Units dataset classifies and delineates areas within the State of California into one of three groundwater-based polygon units: (1) those areas previously defined as alluvial groundwater basins or subbasins, (2) highland areas that are adjacent to and topographically upgradient of groundwater basins, and (3) highland areas not associated with a groundwater basin, only a hydrogeologic province. In total, 938 Groundwater Units are represented. The Groundwater Units dataset relates existing groundwater basins with their newly delineated highland areas which can be used in subsequent hydrologic studies. The methods used to delineate groundwater-basin-associated highland areas are similar to those used to delineate a contributing area (such as for a lake or water body); the difference is that highland areas are constrained to the immediately surrounding upslope (upstream) area. Upslope basins have their own delineated highland.\\xa0Original Metadata.Published:\\xa02014\",\n",

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc.. CLC programme is also a part of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (https://land.copernicus.eu/) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Environment Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.

Most Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) are in the countryside, although a few sites reach into town or city landscapes, such as\\xa0North Dublin Bay. Conservation management plans are available for many SACs. The legal basis on which SACs are selected and designated is the EU Habitats Directive, transposed into Irish law in the as amended in 1998 and 2005. The Directive lists certain habitats and species that must be protected within SACs. Irish habitats include raised bogs, blanket bogs, turloughs, sand dunes, machair (flat sandy plains on the north and west coasts), heaths, lakes, rivers, woodlands, estuaries and sea inlets. The 25 Irish species which must be afforded protection include Salmon, Otter, Freshwater Pearl Mussel, Bottlenose Dolphin and Killarney Fern. The areas chosen as SAC in Ireland cover an area of approximately 13,500 sq. km. Roughly 53% is land, the remainder being marine or large lakes. Across the EU, over 12,600 sites have been identified and proposed, covering 420,000 sq. km of land and sea, an area the size of Germany.Image in thumbnail is that of a stream located in the\\xa0Slieve Bloom Mountains.',\n",

Two configuration options are available. When you configure the element to be static, all you need is the URL of the content to be embedded. When you configure it by features, the element is data driven and you need to identify a\\xa0data source. This means that each feature's attribute information can be used to dynamically construct a URL at run time. When configured by features, the embedded element can be the target of an\\xa0action. Specifically, it can be the target of elements that support a selection change event.Note:Always know the source of the content you are embedding, and ensure that you respect any terms of use.Some websites restrict embedding. This is a choice that some organizations make to protect their content from misuse by third-party users. If this is the case, you can link to the content using\\xa0HTML.The following tips are useful for using URLs in the embedded content element:Avoid using mixed content. If your dashboard will only be accessed over a secure HTTPS connection, use HTTPS in your URL references. Otherwise, consider using a relative URL, which doesn't specify HTTPS or HTTP; for example, use\\xa0//www.example.com/content.html.If the URL references a domain other than your ArcGIS organization, the server hosting the requested resources should support CORS requests from your ArcGIS organization.Note:If you're having trouble embedding content and are familiar with your browser's development tools, you can troubleshoot by monitoring the network traffic. You may see error messages for mixed content or embed restrictions. In the latter case, look for a property named X-Frame-Options in the response header.\",\n",

Forest loss and development can affect water quality and quantity when forests are removed and impervious surfaces, such as paved roads, spread across the landscape. We rank watersheds across the conterminous United States according to the contributions of private forest land to surface drinking water and by threats to surface water from increased housing density. Private forest land contributions to drinking water are greatest in the East but are also important in Western watersheds. Development pressures on these contributions are concentrated in the Eastern United States but are also found in the North-Central region, parts of the West and Southwest, and the Pacific Northwest; nationwide, more than 55 million acres of rural private forest land are projected to experience a substantial increase in housing density from 2000 to 2030. Planners, communities, and private landowners can use a range of strategies to maintain freshwater ecosystems, including designing housing and roads to minimize impacts on water quality, managing home sites to protect water resources, and using payment schemes and management partnerships to invest in forest stewardship on public and private lands.This data is based on the digital hydrologic unit boundary layer to the Subwatershed (12-digit) 6th level for the continental United States. To focus this analysis on watersheds with private forests, only watersheds with at least 10% forested land and more than 50 acres of private forest were analyzed. All other watersheds were labeled ?Insufficient private forest for this analysis&quot;and coded -99999 in the data table.

Surveyors relied on descriptions from the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (WADNR) late-seral forested plant associations of the Puget Lowland (Chappell 2005), freshwater wetland vegetation (Kunze 1994), and intertidal vegetation (Kunze and Cornelius 1982) to make final vegetation community assignments. In some cases, the WADNR descriptions were not adequate in describing existing vegetation associations. In these cases, alternative vegetation communities or plant associations were created by PBI.Remote sensing techniques consisted of manually delineating plant associations or mosaics of plant associations in a digital environment. Orthorectified aerial photography and LANDSAT Thematic Mapper satellite images were reviewed for discernable vegetation or landform patterns. When available, we also high-resolution true color orthorectified aerial photography was also used. Topographic maps, digital elevation models (DEMs), and light detection and ranging imagery (LIDAR) were also employed (where available) to assist the process of vegetation community delineation. The vegetation polygons were created by hand in GIS by ocular assessment. Field surveys consisted of visiting sites located within the vegetation polygons created during the remote sensing process. At representative sites within a polygon, vegetation data and site descriptions were recorded in a fashion consistent with the plant community polygon format. Further refinements and editing of the initial vegetation polygon layers were done by hand on hard copy\\xa0maps in the field, and later edited digitally in GIS to create the final vegetation polygon layers.',\n",

The layer was created from the 2014 SSURGO \\nsnapshot.The seven classes of hydrologic soil group are:Group A\\n soils have a high infiltration rate and low runoff. These soils consist\\n of deep, well drained sands or gravelly sands and have a high rate of \\nwater transmission.Group B\\n soils have a moderate infiltration rate. This group consists chiefly of\\n deep well drained soils with a moderately fine to moderately coarse \\ntexture and a moderate rate of water transmission.Group C\\n soils have a slow infiltration rate. This group consists of soils with a\\n layer that impedes the downward movement of water or fine textured \\nsoils and a slow rate of water transmission.Group D\\n soils have a very slow infiltration rate and high runoff potential. \\nThis group is composed of clays that have a high shrink-swell potential,\\n soils with a high water table, soils that have a claypan or clay layer \\nat or near the surface, and soils that are shallow over nearly \\nimpervious material. These soils have a very slow rate of water \\ntransmission.If a soil is placed in group D because of a high water table it may be assigned to a dual hydrologic group: A/D, B/D, or C/D. The first letter of the pair represents the soil’s group if drained and the D represents the natural condition.For more information on soil hydrologic groups see the Natural Resources Conservation Service's\\xa0National Engineering Handbook.The original gSSURGO dataset is available from the\\xa0NRCS’s Geospatial Data Gateway.Link to source metadata\",\n",

There are currently 48 natural gas pipelines representing approximately 28 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day of capacity, importing and exporting natural gas between the U.S. and Canada or Mexico. In 2016, the U.S. increased imports of natural gas by 10% to 3,001 Bcf. More than 97% of U.S. natural gas imports come by pipeline from Canada and very little (1 Bcf) was imported by way of Mexico. Natural gas export from the U.S. increased by 30% to 2,315 Bcf in 2016 which was a new record high level. Pipeline exports accounted for 92% of U.S. exports with exports to Canada rising 10% and Mexico by 29% which was a new record. The expansion of the U.S. cross-border pipeline network into Mexico has been driven primarily by strong growth in Mexico's natural gas demand in the power sector, declining domestic production and lower prices of U.S. pipeline gas compared with the more expensive liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports.Natural Gas Border CrossingsData currency: July 7, 2016Data source:\\xa0MAPSFor more information, please visit:\\xa0Natural Gas Import/Export PipelinesFor feedback:\\xa0ArcGIScomNationalMaps@esri.comThumbnail source image courtesy of:\\xa0Vicki WatkinsOther Federal User Community federally focused content that may interest you\\xa0U.S. Department of Energy\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Energy Information Administration\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: USDOE\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: EIA\",\n",

In December 2010, the Tigard City Council adopted the 2035 Transportation System Plan (TSP) that links    expected growth with transportation needs. This update is timely for two reasons. First, traffic congestion    has consistently ranked as the number one issue facing Tigard in community attitude surveys and the    City is committed to finding solutions to this issue. Secondly, the community has developed a vision    for Tigard's future and a key component of this vision is developing an efficient and balanced multi-modal    transportation system.      The 2035 TSP sets the policy framework for the city's transportation system. It includes a list of strategies    and projects that will guide future investments. The strategies range from access management, to connectivity    improvements, to &quot;smarter&quot; traffic signals. There are more than 140 identified transportation projects    ranging from sidewalk infill to freeway over-passes. Identification of these transportation projects is    important because in order to qualify for federal transportation funds they must be identified in the TSP.   Transportation funds are limited and highly competitive for large expensive projects. For this reason,    a major theme of this TSP update is the need to make the most out of the existing transportation system.    We believe this can be accomplished through effective management and strategic investments such as    improved street connections, new trails, sidewalks, bicycle facilities, intersection improvements,    and transit service. All of these improvements are aimed at providing safe and efficient transportation    options for the community.For general information visit the City's home page.

Ancillary data sources included GIS data provided by Lake County or created by the UVM Spatial Analysis Laboratory. This hydrography dataset is considered current as of Summer, 2013. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract hydrography information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. Following the automated OBIA mapping a detailed manual review of the dataset was carried out at a scale of 1:2,500 and all observable errors were corrected.DISCLAIMER The\\n data on this website is provided 'as is' without warranty of accuracy, \\ntimeliness or completeness.

An unsupervised classification was performed to identify, isolate, and differentiate mountain top removal mining sites from naturally vegetated areas using 50 pixel colors.  This was done by manually selecting pixels from the imagery and designating them as MTR or NonMTR sites.  The image was then reclassified to only display areas identified as MTR sites.  The resulting image was then converted into a polygon and stored in the geodatabase.  The last step take was to remove unnecessary items from within the now polygon layer.  Areas not with in a specific range to a mountain ridges and areas.  This is because MTR mining is focused on the higher areas of the mountains.  And areas within a specific proximity to rivers and roadways were removed.  This is because of the similarities in pixel colors to water and roads.\\n\\nWorking on this project was very interesting.  The tools and processes involved in reaching the most accurate product were great to work with and learn.  The only true issue I experienced was with the unsupervised classification of the raster pixels when attempting to identfy the MTR sites in the study area.  The issue was the abundance of non MTR pixels the were accidentially selected leading to an inaccurate MTR acreage.  I attempted the analysis to two separate occations.  Fortunately I was the fifth man in the group and my data was not needed which kept our qroups data accuracy high.',\n",

In December 2010, the Tigard City Council adopted the 2035 Transportation System Plan (TSP) that links    expected growth with transportation needs. This update is timely for two reasons. First, traffic congestion    has consistently ranked as the number one issue facing Tigard in community attitude surveys and the    City is committed to finding solutions to this issue. Secondly, the community has developed a vision    for Tigard's future and a key component of this vision is developing an efficient and balanced multi-modal    transportation system.      The 2035 TSP sets the policy framework for the city's transportation system. It includes a list of strategies    and projects that will guide future investments. The strategies range from access management, to connectivity    improvements, to &quot;smarter&quot; traffic signals. There are more than 140 identified transportation projects    ranging from sidewalk infill to freeway over-passes. Identification of these transportation projects is    important because in order to qualify for federal transportation funds they must be identified in the TSP.   Transportation funds are limited and highly competitive for large expensive projects. For this reason,    a major theme of this TSP update is the need to make the most out of the existing transportation system.    We believe this can be accomplished through effective management and strategic investments such as    improved street connections, new trails, sidewalks, bicycle facilities, intersection improvements,    and transit service. All of these improvements are aimed at providing safe and efficient transportation    options for the community.For general information visit the City's home page.

Each MOE is expressed in the same units as its corresponding measure; for example, if the estimate value is expressed as a number, then its MOE will also be a number; if the estimate value is expressed as a percent, then its MOE will also be a percent.\\xa0\\xa0The user should also note that for relatively small geographic areas, such as census tracts shown here, ACS only releases combined 5-year estimates, meaning these estimates represent rolling averages of survey results that were collected over a 5-year span (in this case 2013-2017). Therefore, these data do not represent any one specific point in time or even one specific year.

Therefore, the GIS data presented herein are approximations and further land development determination is at the discretion of the PRMD planning staff which may require a parcel specific site review (to draw parcel specific conclusions). Please see Access and Use Constraints.The parcel dataset represents ONLY unincorporated Sonoma County land and takes into account all recorded annexations as of April 2017.\\xa0The parcel dataset is based on an original parcel base obtained from the County of Sonoma, ISD/GIS (a.k.a. Central GIS). Due to the sensitive nature of land development datasets maintained by Sonoma County Permit and Resource Management Department [PRMD], only those parcels which have been reassigned a parcel number [APN] or have been reconfigured due to lot line adjustments, subdivision and/or merger/splits, are updated by PRMD GIS staff. [Note: Should you wish to obtain Central GIS, a non-ActiveMap/PRMD, parcel base dataset, please research vector data download link https://gis.sonoma-county.org/catalog.asp.] A distinction should be made with respect to this layer which includes GIS parcels and the official Assessor Parcels residing in the Assessor Map books at the Sonoma County Assessor Office. For official parcel records please contact the Sonoma County Assessor (707)565-1888. These parcels should NOT be represented as survey data, and the official record of survey takes precedence where there are discrepancies. It is the end user's responsibility to check the accuracy of the GIS data by comparing it with the published data from the Sonoma County Assessor / Recorder office. The Sonoma County parcel base was originally compiled from Assessor Parcel maps at a scale of 1:6000. The individual Assessor Parcel maps were enlarged or reduced in size using an electrostatic process to produce the maps at the 1:6000 scale, the maps were then fit together by hand and transcribed on to mylar. The mylar base consisted of 1:6000 USGS base map information typically found on the 7.5 USGS quad series. This base information consisted of Topography, Roads, Section, and Rancho lines to name some. Using this information, the Assessor Parcel maps were fit to the individual 1:6000 scale maps. Each 1:6000 scale map represents 1/6 (quad sixths) of a 7.5 minute USGS Quadrangle series map. In 1998 the State Board of Equalization provided the impetus to produce the Russian River Project for all of Planning Area 4. One aspect required for this project was a digital parcel base for Planning Area 4. This involved the conversion of the 1:6000 mylars with the transcribed parcels on them into a digital version of the parcels. The mylars where scanned and geo-referenced using the base map information originally included with the 1:6000 mylar base. The maps were geo-referenced to a digital version of the USGS 7.5 minute Quadrangle series available from the Teale Data Center. The original projection was California State Plane Zone 2 NAD 1927. County Staff then used AutoCAD software to heads up digitize each 1:6000 scale map in Planning Area 4. A custom application was created and used by GIS staff involving the use of Avenue and ArcView 3.2 to create a point for all the parcels in Planning Area 4, attributes included Assessor Parcel Number. The DWGs were then converted to shapefiles and then converted to ArcINFO coverages, the parcel tags were converted from shapefiles to ArcINFO coverages and the point coverage was merged with the polygon coverage with the IDENTITY command. An exhaustive process was involved to eliminate errors once the DWGs were converted to ArcINFO coverages so polygons could be generated. The coverages were then aggregated using the MAPJOIN command, the original boundary of the 1:6000 scale maps was removed using the REGIONDISSOLVE command to merge adjacent polygons with the same AP number. In 1999 the remainder of the planning areas were converted to digital form following the Russian River Project and the seamless base was completed in 2001. The seamless parcel base was maintained in ArcINFO until the release of ArcGIS 8.3, which included topology tools necessary for its maintenance. The seamless base prior to late 2002 was suitable for 1:100000 scale while the control points (the corners for the 1:6000 scale maps) were suitable for 1:24000 scale. Prior to rectification to the Merrick 2000 orthophotography, the parcel data were derived from 1:6000 scale maps (enlarged from USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle 1:24,000 series) and digitized in California State Plane, Zone II, NAD 27 coordinates (survey feet), but were converted to California State Plane, Zone II, NAD 83 coordinates (survey feet) as part of a rectification process now underway. The parcels used to use the USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle (1:24,000) series for coordinate control, but no guarantee is made for their spatial accuracy. The data were re-projected to NAD 83 coordinates to overlay the orthophotography, but the parcel boundaries will not correspond precisely with features in the images. The parcels were rectified to orthophotography flown in April - May 2000 using geo-referencing tools available in ArcGIS 8.3. This project was completed in July 2005. In general, the parcels meet National Accuracy Standards for 1:24,000 scale maps, and likely exceed that accuracy in urban areas. A complete description of the process is detailed in a series of documents located on a local file server: S:\\\\COMMON\\\\GIS\\\\Documentation\\\\Parcel Rectification & Update Process\\\\Procedure - *. doc. A brief summary is as follows. Individual Assessor Parcel pages or CAD drawings are rectified to the orthophoto. COGO & survey data are used when available and in sufficient quantities to enable the bulk of an Assessor Parcel page to be digitized using said information. Polygons are generated directly from the COGO data, CAD dwg are exported to feature classes, where polygons are then generated, rectified Assessor Parcel pages are vectorized using ArcScan and subsequently polygons are generated. A spatial join is used to assign attributes to the newly generated polygons. Polygons are then assigned an accuracy rank based on source, quality of the fit to the orthophoto, and RMS error encountered during rectification (only the scanned Assessor maps will have and RMS error associated with them). See the fields RANK and DESCRIPTION for information on fit assessment. Areas that have been successfully updated as such have a reasonable expectation of accuracy of +/- 10 and possibly better, areas that have not been updated or are flagged in SCAMP (http://sc-gis/web/scamp/browse.jsp) under the GIS group Projects as Needs Survey Data, the original accuracy assessment of 1:100000 applies.\",\n",

       "  'dc_description_s': 'Aerial Information Systems, Inc. (AIS) was contracted by the Western Riverside County Regional Conservation Authority to perform an update to their original 2005 Western Riverside Vegetation Map. The project was funded through a Local Assistance Grant from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). The original vegetation layer was created in 2005 using a baseline image dataset created from 2000/01 Emerge imagery flown in early spring. The original map has been used to monitor and evaluate the habitat in the Western Riverside County Multi-species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP). An update to the original map was needed to address changes in vegetation makeup that have occurred in the intervening years due to widespread and multiple burns in the mapping area, urban expansion, and broadly occurring vegetation succession.The update conforms to the standards set by the National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS) published in 2008 by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. (FGDC-STD-005-2008, Vegetation Subcommittee, Federal Geographic Data Committee, February 2008) The update also adheres to the vegetation types as represented in the 2008-second edition of the Manual of California Vegetation (MCV2). Extensive ground based field data both within and nearby the western Riverside County mapping area has been acquired since the completion of the project in 2005. This additional data has resulted in the reclassification of several vegetation types that are addressed in the updated vegetation map. The mapping area covers 1,017,364 acres of the original 1.2 million acres mapped in the 2005 study. The new study covers portions of the Upper Santa Ana River Valley, Perris Plain, and the foothills of the San Jacinto and Santa Ana Mountains but excludes US Forest Service land. The final geodatabase includes both an updated 2012 vegetation map and a retroactively corrected 2005 vegetation base layer. Vegetative and cartographic comparisons between the newly created 2012 image-based map and the original vegetation map produced in 2005 are described in this report.The Update mapping was performed using baseline digital imagery created in 2012 by the US Department of Agriculture – Farm Service Agency’s National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP). Vegetation units were mapped using the National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS) to the Alliance and Association level as depicted in the MCV2. Approximately 55% of the study area is classified to vegetated or naturally occurring sparsely vegetated types; the remaining 45% is unvegetated, with over a third (36%) in urban development and an additional 9% in agriculture. The major tasks for the Update project consisted of updating the original mapping classification to conform to the changes and refinements to the MCV2 classification, updating the existing vegetation map to 2012 conditions, retroactively correcting the 2005 vegetation interpretations, creating the final report and project metadata, and producing the final vegetation geodatabase. After completion of the original 2005 vegetation map, CDFW crosswalked the original mapping units to the NVCS hierarchical names as defined in the Manual of California Vegetation (MCV).The original crosswalk was revised during the Update effort to reflect changes in the original MCV classification as depicted in the second edition (MCV2). Changes were minor and did not result in a significant effort in the updating process. The updating process in many steps is similar to the creation of the original vegetation map. First, photo interpreters review the study area for terrain, environmental features, and probable vegetation types present. Questionable photo signatures on the new baseline imagery (2012 NAIP) were compared to the original 2000/01 Emerge imagery. Photo signatures for a given vegetation polygon were correlated between the two image datasets. Production level updates to the linework and labeling commenced following the correlation of the two baseline image datasets and the subsequent refinement of photo interpretation criteria & biogeographical descriptions of the types.

       "  'dc_description_s': \"The ABMIw2wLCV2010 was derived by applying a semantic and spatial generalization algorithm (Castilla et al., in preparation), and later updating to 2010 conditions, to a combination of two raster datasets: the Canadian Forest Service (CFS) Earth Observation for Sustainable Development (EOSD) LC dataset, and the Land Cover for Agricultural Regions of Canada, circa 2000 (LCARC, a.k.a. NLWIS) dataset of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC). Both datasets were created using digital classification of Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 ortho-images acquired around year 2000, with each Landsat scene classified individually and then mosaicked into the final raster product. NB. Both rasters use the same hierachical classification scheme. This feature class was obtained by merging 48 individual tiles whose frames are provided in the ABMIw2wLCV2000_48tiles feature class. Each tile is completely within a single Landsat scene, and its boundary roughly coincides with the seam lines used to stitch together the EOSD. Each map tile was created as follows:(0) The EOSD and NLWIS rasters were combined into a single raster according to a ruleset that selects a label for each pixel based on the values for that pixel in the two rasters. See the description of the SOURCE* fields in the ABMIw2wLCV2000_48tiles for further details. Lakes, rivers, pipelines, powerlines, railways and roads from the Government of Alberta (GoA) GIS layers were also 'burned' in this combined raster.(1) A morphological segmentation algorithm is applied to the gradient magnitude (a sort of 'edge' image) of the original Landsat image used to derive the EOSD, in order to break it down into a mosaic of tiny homogeneous regions (mean segment size around 10 pixels) separated by 1-pixel thick boundaries. NB. The edges of the features copied from the GoA's layers area are enhanced in the gradient magnitude image so as to preserve their shape in the output segmentation.(2)Regions having a clearly predominant landcover class ( more than 75% of its pixels belong to that class) are assigned to it, and adjacent regions having the same class are merged together. This results in a big portion of the image (usually more than 90%) being already labeled.(3)Endmembers, or typical spectral signatures (i.e., mean value in each band of the Landsat image) for each class are derived from these regions. (4)Unlabeled regions are assigned to the class of the most similar neighbour, providing the latter is already classified and bears enough similarity to it, ortherwise they are assigned to the class with the highest relative abundace within the region, where the latter is abundance weighted by distance in the feature space between the spectral signature of the region and the endmember of each class. Once again, adjacent regions having the same class are merged together after the assigment. NB. There are special rules on how to deal with semantically related classes, such as conifer, broadleaf and mixed forest. (5) Regions are reclassified into the final set of 11 landcover classes using a predefined crosswalk table, after which adjacent regions having the same class are merged together. NB. Treed wetlands (class 81 in EOSD) greater than 100 ha are assumed to be black spruce and thus conifer. Smaller treed wetlands are assigned to the class of the closest forest endmembers.(6) Regions smaller than the minimum mapping unit (MMU: 0.5 ha for water and 2 ha for the rest) are merged to their most similar adjacent neighbour. (7) Isolated regions smaller than 25 ha that show a low contrast with the encompassing region were eliminated, as they were found in a previous version to mainly correspond to spurious polygons.(8) Using the center of boundary pixels as initial vertices, the result is converted to an ESRI polygon shapefile using a line simplification algorithm. Once all tiles were ready, the final product was created by merging and dissolving the individual tiles into a seamless layer. After dissolving, a few seam lines were still visible due to differing classifications in the adjoining tiles. The labels of polygons affected by these inconsistencies were harmonized using semi-automated GIS procedures, after which a final 'dissolve' was performed.The circa 2000 map was updated to circa 2010 conditions using a hybrid procedure that included a combination of change detection and GIS techniques. The map was updated for new features appearing in the 2000-2010 period of the following types: forestry cutblocks, wildfires, surface mines, roads and urban development. Cutblocks were extracted from the cumulative ABMI cutblock layer. A difference image (NDVI2000 – NDVI2010) was computed, and statistics for each cutblock polygon were derived. Cutblocks harvested between 2000 and 2010 were preselected by thresholding and those close to the threshold were visually inspected before the final selection. The wildfires were extracted from GoA’s Historical Wildfire Perimeter Dataset using a similar procedure than for the cutblocks. Mines, roads and urban were extracted from the 2010 ABMI Human Footprint dataset using GIS overlay operations that compared these with preexisting features of this type in the 2000 map. The different types of new features were integrated into a single disturbance layer, the outlines of this layer were generalized to give them a similar appearance than those of the 2000 map, the disturbance layer was stamped on top of the 2000 map, and slivers (small polygons resulting from boundary mistmatches) were removed. The Landcover_Polygons_2010 feature class has a new field called ‘MOD_TY’ (modifier type) that records the type of disturbance a new polygon not belonging to the developed class is. Possible values are ‘Cutblock’, ‘Burnt’, ‘Mining’ and ‘Tailing pond’ (the latter belongs to water class). NB. Cutblocks, mines and other disturbance features that already existed in 2000 have their MOD_TY field blank in this version.Landcover class definitions (field LC_class):20 - Water: lakes, lagoons, rivers, canals, and artificial water bodies. Shallow open water is included in this category, unless there is more than 20% vegetation cover, in which case it belongs to the relevant vegetated class.31 - Snow/Ice: areas permanently covered by snow or ice, including glaciers. 32 - Rock/Rubble: bedrock, rubble, talus, blockfield, lava beds, or other natural impervious surfaces. 33 - Exposed Land: bare soil (barren, non-agricultural), river sediments and cutbanks, pond or lake sediments, reservoir margins, beaches, landings, fresh (less than 1yr) cutblocks, recently burned areas, mudflat sediments, surface mining, or other non-vegetated (less than 10% trees, or less than 20% shrub/herb) surfaces. 34 - Developed: urban and built-up areas (including industrial sites), impervious artificial surfaces (e.g. airport runaways), railways and roads. Acreages and farmsteads are included in this class. Oil and gas well pads are included in this class if connected to a road and not abandoned or under reclamation. Urban terrain under development is included in this class, even if the land is exposed. Urban green areas are excluded of this class if larger than 2 ha and if they have less than 2 buildings per hectare. 50 - Shrubland: At least 20% ground cover which is at least one-third shrub (shrub: a woody plant not considered a tree), with no or little presence of trees (less than10% crown closure). Examples of plants belonging to this class in Alberta are alder, willow, juniper, and sagebrush. Shrubby fens and other non-treed woody wetlands, usually associated with floodplains and the shores of lakes and streams, belong to this class. Recent clearcuts and forest fires are initially labeled as shrubland to differntiate them from the surrounding forest.110 - Grassland: Predominantly native grasses and other non-woody vegetation (e.g., forbs) with a minimum of 20% ground cover. May include some shrub cover (but less than a third of the vegetated area) or a few trees (but the tree cover cannot exceed 10%). Land used for range with native unimproved grasses (a.k.a. rough pasture) is included in this class. Alpine meadows fall into this class. Marshes and other non-woody wetlands with at least 20% vegetation cover (sedges, cattails, or moss) belong to this class. NB. A forestry cutblock harvested more than year ago that contains seedlings, but where the latter cover less than 10% of the area of the cutblock, belongs to this class. If the cutblock had no successful regeneration and was covered by more than 20% shrubs, then it would belong to the 'shrubland' class.120 - Agriculture: annually cultivated crops, tame pastures (fields planted or sown with non-native grasses/legumes where livestock is directly grazing on them in the summer), forage crops (same as the previous, but instead of grazed, cut for hay) and woody perennial crops (fruit orchards and vineyards). Bare agricultural (i.e., tilled) soil belongs to this class and not to 'exposed land'.210 - Coniferous Forest: Treed areas with at least a 10% ground cover of trees (a.k.a. crown closure), where coniferous trees (spruce, pine, fir, larch) are 75% or more of the crown closure. Young plantations or regenerating cutblocks of conifer trees belong to this class no matter that the trees are less than 5 m tall, providing crown closure has reached 10%. Treed wetlands (e.g., black spruce bogs and fens) are included in this class providing they are conifer dominated and crown closure exceeds10%.220 - Broadleaf Forest: Treed areas with at least a 10% ground cover of trees, where broadleaf trees (trembling aspen, balsam poplar, white birch) are 75% or more of the crown closure. Young plantations or regenerating cutblocks of broadleaf trees belong to this class no matter that the trees are less than 5 m tall, providing crown closure has reached 10%. Treed swamps along river floodplains and other treed wetlands are included in this class providing they are broadleaf dominated and crown closure exceeds 10%.230 - Mixed Forest: Treed areas with at least a 10% ground cover of trees, where neither coniferous nor broadleaf trees account for 75% or more of crown closure.The overall thematic accuracy of the map, as estimated by an extensive validation dataset (see description of the relevant feature class) is 75% with 11 classes, and 88% if these classes are grouped into 5 general classes. User and Producer accuracies for specific classes in each level appear in tables appended to this geodatabase. Caveats:The width of roads has been systematically exaggerated to a minimum of 60 m (two Landsat pixels); therefore the real extent of the Developed class is greatly overestimated.Forest areas harvested or burned between 2000 and 2010 were assigned to the ‘Shrub’ LC class to differentiate them from their surroundings. They can be identified using the ‘MOD_TY’ field, which will respectively contain the value ‘Cutblock’ or ‘Burnt’.The accuracy of the shrub class is low (30%). Many shrub polygons are in reality forest (beyond new cutblocks and burnt areas), especially in the North. This was not possible to correct with the input data at hand.\",\n",

Basis of delineation was 1 foot pixel resolution aerial imagery for the periods 2014-2016, NAIP asnd ArcGIS online base imagery. Stand delineation is based on the Photo Interpreter’s (PI) experience and judgment of separating image components into distinct areas of perceived spatial patterns and textural differences. Large continuous areas that have similar texture and characteristics defined through visual observation rarely to exceed 100 acres. Specific characteristics that defined a stand polygon is species composition, size class and stocking (SPSS) as well as significant changes in topography (slope and aspect) and operational boundaries (ridge lines, water courses, roads). The reservation boundary was used to define the extent of the project area. The current sub-watershed boundaries were used to divide the reservation into logical stand delineation areas. Stand Numbering designation is based on the township range and section forming the first 6 digites of the Stand ID followec by a unique stand number. Where stand numbering conflicted, a new stand number was utilized by adding an additional digit onto the end of the number. Additional editing and splitting of polygons was performed where needed, and each polygon typed with the vegetation type call. All Polygons were then merged to produce the overall stand data base into an ESRI Personal Geodatabase. Stand delineation and typing was performed on sub-watershed by delineating differences in vegetation cover and assigning a photo type call to the delineated polygon. This classification sets the four digit code establishing the PI’s best estimate of forest cover observable from remotely sensed data. Following is an SPSS list of the photo typing call identifiers that will be used to establish the four digit photo type code. The 2° code will only be used with 1° codes B_, C_, D_.

The data covers all plants with a combined nameplate capacity of 1 MW (Megawatt) or more.In 2016, most U.S. electricity was generated using fossil fuels. The largest energy source in the U.S. generating 4 trillion kilowatt hours of electricity was natural gas. Natural gas was the source of about 34% of electric generation. The second largest energy source for electricity generation was coal with 30% of all power generation. Petroleum can be burned to produce electric generation, but this source is not a large source in power generation with less than 1% of U.S. electric generation. Nuclear power provided the U.S. with 1/5th of total U.S. electricity or about 20% of all U.S. electricity generation. Renewable energy sources provided 15% of total U.S. electricity in 2016. Hydropower generated 7% of total U.S. electricity generation and about 44% of electricity generation from renewable energy. Electricity generation from wind has increased significantly in the United States since 1970. In 2016, wind power provided almost 6% of U.S. electricity generation and about 37% of electricity generation from renewable energy.Biomass is a material derived from plants or animals and includes lumber, paper mill wastes, food scraps, grass, leaves and paper. Biomass can also include forestry and agricultural residues such as wood chips, corn cobs and wheat straw. However, Biomass has only accounted for 2% of the total U.S. electricity generation in 2016. Solar power produces energy from the sun and in 2016, generated about 1% of U.S. electricity generation. Geothermal power comes from heat energy beneath the surface of the earth. However, here again geothermal power generation was less than 1% of total U.S. electricity generation in 2016.Power PlantsData currency: June 26, 2017Data source:\\xa0MAPSFor more information, please visit:\\xa0Electricity - ExplainedFor feedback:\\xa0ArcGIScomNationalMaps@esri.comThumbnail source image courtesy of:\\xa0Jeanne MenjouletSymbology courtesy of the following\\xa0Noun Project\\xa0contributors:\\xa0Lisa Staudinger, Robert Beerwerth, Nikita Kozin, emilegraphics, Ron Scott, BomSymbols, Andrejs Kirma, Becris, Symbolon and IconathonOther Federal User Community federally focused content that may interest you\\xa0U.S. Department of Energy\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Energy Information Administration\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: USDOE\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: EIA\\xa0',\n",

LandPro2010 should not be taken out of its Regional context, though county-level or municipal-level analysis may be useful for transportation, environmental and landuse planning. LandPro2010 is ARC's landuse/landcover GIS database for the 21-county Atlanta Region (Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry, Rockdale, the EPA non-attainment (8hr standard) counties of Carroll, Coweta, Barrow, Bartow, Forsyth, Hall, Newton, Paulding, Spalding and Walton and Dawson which will become a part of the 2010 Urbanized Area). LandPro2010 was created by on-screen photo-interpretation and digitizing of ortho-rectified aerial photography. The primary source for this GIS database were the local parcels and the 2009 true color imagery with 1.64-foot pixel resolution, provided by Aerials Express, Inc. 2010 is the first year we have used parcel data to help more accurately delineate the LandPro categories.For ArcGIS 10 users: See full metadata by enabling FGDC metadata in ArcCatalog Customize &gt; ArcCatalog Options &gt; Metadata (tab)<span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Though\\r\\nthe terms are often used interchangeably, landuse and landcover are not\\r\\nsynonymous. Landcover generally refers to the natural or cultivated vegetation,\\r\\nrock, or water covering the land, as well as the developed surface which can be\\r\\nidentified on aerial photography. Landuse generally refers to the way that\\r\\nhumans use or will use the land, regardless of its apparent landcover.\\r\\nCollateral data for the landcover mapping effort included the Aero Surveys of\\r\\nGeorgia street atlas, the Georgia Department of Community Affairs (DCA)\\r\\nCommunity Facilities database and the USGS Digital Raster Graphics (DRGs) of\\r\\n1:24,000 scale topographic maps. The landuse component of this database was\\r\\nadded after the landcover interpretation was completed, and is based primarily\\r\\non ownership information provided by the 21 counties and the City of Atlanta\\r\\nfor larger tracts of undeveloped land that meet the landuse definition of\\r\\n&quot;Extensive Institutional&quot; or &quot;Park Lands&quot; (refer to the\\r\\nCode Descriptions and Discussion section below). Although some of the\\r\\nboundaries of these tracts may align with visible features from the aerial\\r\\nphotography, these areas are generally &quot;non-photo-identifiable,&quot; thus\\r\\nrequire other sources for accurate identification. The landuse/cover\\r\\nclassification system is adapted from the USGS (Anderson) classification\\r\\nsystem, incorporating a mix of level I, II and III classes. There are a total\\r\\nof 25 categories in ARC's landuse/cover system (described below), 2 of which\\r\\nare used only for landuse designations: Park Lands (Code 175) and Extensive\\r\\nInstitutional (Code 125). The other 23 categories can describe landuse and/or\\r\\nlandcover, and in most cases will be the same. The LU code will differ from the\\r\\nLC code only where the Park Lands (Code 175) and Extensive Institutional (Code\\r\\n125) land holdings have been identified from collateral sources of land\\r\\nownership.<span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Although\\r\\nsimilar to previous eras of ARC landuse/cover databases developed before 1999\\r\\n(1995, 1990 etc.), &quot;LandPro&quot; differs in many significant ways.\\r\\nOriginally, ARC's landuse and landcover database was built from 1975 data\\r\\ncompiled by USGS at scales of 1:100,000 and selectively, 1:24,000. The coverage\\r\\nwas updated in 1990 using SPOT satellite imagery and low-altitude aerial\\r\\nphotography and again in 1995 using 1:24,000 scale panchromatic aerial\\r\\nphotography. Unlike these previous 5-year updates, the 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005\\r\\n2007, 2008 and 2009 LandPro databases were compiled at a larger scale\\r\\n(1:14,000) and do not directly reflect pre-1999 delineations. In addition, all\\r\\ncomponents of LandPro were produced using digital orthophotos for on-screen\\r\\nphoto-interpretation and digitizing, thus eliminating the use of unrectified\\r\\nphotography and the need for data transfer and board digitizing. As a result,\\r\\nthe positional accuracy of LandPro is much higher than in previous eras. There\\r\\nhave also been some changes to the classification system prior to 1999.\\r\\nPreviously, three categories of Forest (41-deciduous, 42-coniferous, and\\r\\n43-mixed forest) were used; this version does not distinguish between\\r\\nconiferous and deciduous forest, thus Code 40 is used to simply designate\\r\\nForest. Likewise, two categories of Wetlands (61-forested wetland, and\\r\\n62-non-forested wetland) were used before; this version does not distinguish\\r\\nbetween forested and non-forested wetlands, thus Code 60 is used to simply\\r\\ndesignate Wetlands. With regard to Wetlands, the boundaries themselves are now\\r\\nbased on the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) delineations along with the CIR\\r\\nimagery. Furthermore, Code 51 has been renamed &quot;Rivers&quot; from\\r\\n&quot;Streams and Canals&quot; and represents the Chattahoochee and Etowah\\r\\nRivers which have been identified in the landuse/cover database. In addition to\\r\\nthese changes, Code 52 has been dropped from the system as there are no known\\r\\ninstances of naturally occurring lakes in the Region. Finally, the landuse code\\r\\nfor Park Lands has been changed from 173 to 175 so as to minimize confusion\\r\\nwith the Parks landcover code, 173. There has been a change in the agriculture\\r\\nclassification for LandPro2005 and any LandPro datasets hereafter. Previously,\\r\\nfour categories of agriculture (21- agriculture-cropland and pasture, 22 -\\r\\nagriculture - orchards, 23 - agriculture - confined feeding operations and 24 -\\r\\nagriculture - other) were used; this version does not distinguish between the\\r\\ndifferent agricultural lands. Code 20 is now used to designate agriculture. Due\\r\\nto new technology and the enhancements to this database, direct comparison\\r\\nbetween LandPro99, LandPro2001, LandPro2003 and landPro2005 and all successive\\r\\nupdates are now possible, with the 1999 database serving as ARC's new baseline.\\r\\nPlease note that as a result of the 2003 mapping effort, LandPro2001 has been\\r\\nadjusted for better comparison to LandPro2003 and is named &quot;LandPro01_adj.&quot;\\r\\nLikewise, LandPro99 was previously adjusted when LandPro2001 was completed, but\\r\\nwas not further adjusted following the 2003 update. Although some adjustments\\r\\nwere originally made to the 1995 landuse/cover database for modeling\\r\\napplications, direct comparisons to previous versions of ARC landuse/cover\\r\\nbefore 1999 should be avoided in most cases.<span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The\\r\\n2010 update has gone away from using the (1:14,000) scale, as will any future\\r\\nupdates. Do to the use of local parcels, we have begun to snap LandPro boundaries\\r\\nto the parcel data, making a more accurate dataset. The major change in this\\r\\nupdate was to make residential areas reflect modern zoning codes more closely.\\r\\nDo to these changes you will no longer be able to compare this dataset to\\r\\nprevious years. High density (113) has change from lots below .25 to lots .25\\r\\nand smaller. Medium density (112) has changed from .25 to 2 acre lots, to .26\\r\\nto 1 acre lots. Low density has changed from 2 to 5 acre lots to 1.1 to 2 acre\\r\\nlots. It must be noted that in the 2010 update, you still have old acreage\\r\\nstandards reflected in the low density. This will be corrected in the 2011 and\\r\\n2012 updates. The main focus of the 2010 update was to make sure the LandPro'\\r\\nresidential areas reflected the local parcels and change LandPro based on the\\r\\nparcel acreage. DeKalb is the only county not corrected at this time because no\\r\\nparcels were available. The future updates will consist of but are not limited\\r\\nto, reclassifying areas in 111 that do not meet the new acreage standards,\\r\\ndelineating and reclassifying Cell Towers, substations and transmission\\r\\nlines/power cuts from TCU (14) to a subset of this (142), reclassifying\\r\\nairports as 141 form TCU, and reclassifying landfills form urban other (17) to\\r\\n174. Other changes are delineating more roads other than just Limited Access\\r\\nHighways, making sure parks match the already existing Landuse parks layer, and\\r\\nbeginning to differentiate office from commercial and commercial/industrial.\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Classification\\r\\nSystem:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>111:\\r\\nLow Density Single Family Residential - Houses on 1.1 - 2 acre lots.

Housing on\\r\\nmilitary bases, campuses, resorts, agricultural properties and construction\\r\\nwork sites is not included in this or other residential categories. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>119:\\r\\nMobile Home Parks - Areas that have been developed for single family mobile\\r\\nhome use. These residential areas may occur in urban, suburban, or rural zones\\r\\nthroughout the Region, with or without a significant mix of forested landcover.\\r\\nDue to their sparse distribution, individual mobile homes are generally mapped\\r\\nwith the Forest landcover (Code 40) and Low- or Medium-Density Residential\\r\\n(Codes 111 and 112, respectively). \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>12:\\r\\nCommercial and Services - Areas used predominantly for the sale of products and\\r\\nservices, including urban central business districts, shopping centers in\\r\\nsuburban and outlying areas, commercial strip developments, junk yards and\\r\\nresorts. The main buildings, secondary structures and areas supporting the\\r\\nbasic use are all included: office buildings, warehouses, driveways, sheds,\\r\\nparking lots, landscaped areas, waste disposal areas, etc. Commercial areas may\\r\\ninclude some non-commercial uses too small to be separated out. Central\\r\\nbusiness districts commonly include some institutions such as churches and\\r\\nschools, and commercial strip developments may include some residential units. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>121:\\r\\nIntensive Institutional - The built-up portions of institutional land holdings,\\r\\nincluding all buildings, grounds and parking lots that compose educational,\\r\\nreligious, health, correctional and military facilities. Institutions occupying\\r\\nsmall areas (for example, many churches and some elementary and secondary\\r\\nschools) may be included in other categories, principally residential or\\r\\ncommercial. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>125:\\r\\nExtensive Institutional - Public or private land holdings devoted to\\r\\neducational, religious, health, correctional, or military landuse. This\\r\\ncategory is one of only two that is used exclusively for landuse\\r\\nclassifications, the other being Park Lands (Code 175). As the Metropolitan\\r\\nPlanning Organization (MPO) for Atlanta, ARC is required to produce long range\\r\\npopulation and employment forecasts which are used in transportation modeling.\\r\\nThe landuse categories of Extensive Institutional and Park Lands are important\\r\\nto ARC's long range forecasts since large tracts of land controlled by\\r\\ngovernments and institutions are more likely to be withheld from residential,\\r\\ncommercial, or industrial development. Unlike Intensive Institutional (Code\\r\\n121) which is visible on, and delineated from, the digital aerial photography,\\r\\nExtensive Institutional can only be identified and mapped from collateral data\\r\\nsources. The primary source of this information comes from the GIS Coordinators\\r\\nfor each of the 21 counties and the City of Atlanta who reviewed the previous\\r\\ndesignations and provided updated information and additional GIS or CAD data.\\r\\nVarious secondary sources include hardcopy, digital and internet maps and\\r\\nfiles. Please note, the built-up landcover portion of these various tracts of\\r\\nland are generally identified as Intensive Institutional (Code 121). The\\r\\nExtensive Institutional landuse areas identify the full extent of these tracts\\r\\nwhich are both built-up and non-built-up. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>13:\\r\\nIndustrial - Land associated with light or heavy manufacturing. Light\\r\\nindustries, those focused on design, assembly, finishing, processing and\\r\\npackaging of products, can be difficult to identify using aerial photography.\\r\\nHeavy industries, those focused on the use of raw materials, such as timber and\\r\\nsteel, are relatively uncommon in the Atlanta Region, but the category may\\r\\ninclude lumber mills and tank farms, as well as chemical, cement and\\r\\nbrick-making plants. For this mapping effort, industrial landcover is more\\r\\ncommonly captured with the Industrial and Commercial Complexes category (Code\\r\\n15) which is described below. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>14:\\r\\nTransportation, Communication and Utilities - Also referred to as\\r\\n&quot;TCU,&quot; this category encompasses various landuse types associated\\r\\nwith transportation, communication, and utilities. Much of the automotive\\r\\ntransportation is accounted for in other categories, particularly highways and\\r\\ntheir right-of-ways, which are either absorbed into the context of a more\\r\\ndominant landcover (e.g. residential or commercial), or are covered completely\\r\\nwithin the Limited Access Highways category (Code 145) described below. Other\\r\\ntypes of transportation include service and terminal facilities, railways\\r\\n(including MARTA) and their stations, parking lots, roundhouses, repair and\\r\\nswitching yards, as well as overland track and spur connections. Airport\\r\\nfacilities may include runways, terminals, service buildings, navigation aids,\\r\\nfuel storage, parking lots, and intervening land. Similar to streets and\\r\\nhighways, communication and utility networks generally fall below the minimum\\r\\nmapping standards, thus are not separated out of the context of the larger\\r\\nlanduse with which they are associated. When practical, areas involved in the\\r\\nprocessing, treatment and transportation of water, gas, oil, and electricity,\\r\\nsuch as pumping stations and electric substations have been delineated. Likewise,\\r\\nareas used for airwave communications, such as radio, radar, or television may\\r\\nbe mapped in this category. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>145:\\r\\nLimited Access Highways - This category identifies all highways, or portions of\\r\\nhighways that are considered &quot;limited access,&quot; their approximate\\r\\nright-of-ways, ramps and interchanges. In addition to the 8 interstate highways\\r\\nin the Region (I-20, I-75, I-85, I-285, I-575, I-595, I-675, and I-985), this\\r\\ncategory includes the entire extents of the Stone Mountain Freeway, Ronald\\r\\nReagan Parkway, Freedom Parkway, Arthur Langford Parkway, the Canton Road\\r\\nConnector, and Spur 14 connecting the South Fulton Parkway to I-285. Likewise,\\r\\nportions of the Camp Creek Parkway, Appalachian Highway, Peachtree Industrial\\r\\nBoulevard, and Georgia Highway 316 are also included. Finally, cartographic\\r\\nlicense was taken with Georgia Highway 400 to extend this designation northward\\r\\nthrough Forsyth County, slightly beyond where interchanges stop and\\r\\nintersections begin, thus ceasing to actually be limited access highway. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>15:\\r\\nIndustrial and Commercial Complexes - Industrial and commercial areas that\\r\\ntypically occur together or in close functional proximity with one another. For\\r\\nthis mapping effort, based primarily on the interpretation of aerial\\r\\nphotography, industrial areas are more commonly grouped in this category than\\r\\nin the Industrial (Code 13) category. In as much as various functions, such as\\r\\nwarehousing, wholesaling and occasionally retailing may be found in the same\\r\\nstructures or adjacent structures, this more inclusive category has been used\\r\\nto combine commercial with industrial.

Examples include water control structures\\r\\nand spillways, waste dumps, landfills, golf driving ranges and other recreation\\r\\nareas not identified as parks. This category excludes golf courses, cemeteries\\r\\nand active parks, which are contained in separate categories.\\xa0 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>171:\\r\\nGolf Courses - The &quot;green space&quot; areas of golf courses, including\\r\\ntees, fairways, greens and intervening land. Forest areas and ponds are often\\r\\nincluded, but may also be identified separately (Code 40 and 53, respectively)\\r\\ndepending on their size.

Because of their\\r\\nunique photo &quot;signature,&quot; many small cemeteries can be identified\\r\\nfrom the digital imagery at a scale of 1:14,000; many others, however, may be\\r\\ncombined with residential, commercial, forest, or agriculture landcover.

Cropland and Pasture are regularly used to\\r\\ngrow field crops or to pasture animals. Orchards, Vineyards and Nurseries are\\r\\nland used to produce fruit, nuts or living plants for sale or for propagation.\\r\\nConfined Feeding Operations are land used for specialized livestock production\\r\\nenterprises where large animal populations are restricted to small areas. Such\\r\\nland uses include cattle feed lots, dairy operations with little or no pasture,\\r\\nlarge poultry farms and hog feed lots. Shipping corrals and other temporary\\r\\nholding facilities are generally excluded, as are horse farms and equestrian\\r\\nfacilities which have lower animal population densities. Agriculture-Other is\\r\\nland used for livestock holding, breeding and training areas, including\\r\\nfarmsteads and associated infrastructure, such as small farm lanes, roads,\\r\\nditches, canals and ponds. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>40:\\r\\nForest - All forested areas of coniferous and/or deciduous trees. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>51:\\r\\nRivers - The Chattahoochee River extending from Buford Dam in Gwinnett and\\r\\nForsyth counties south to Heard County and the Etowah River extending from the\\r\\nBartow, Floyd County boundary to the Allatoona Dam. Other &quot;linear&quot;\\r\\nwater bodies, such as smaller rivers, streams, creeks, and canals fall below\\r\\nthe mapping standards used for inclusion in this category. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>53:\\r\\nReservoirs, Lakes, and Ponds - Man-made impoundments, often referred to as\\r\\n&quot;lakes&quot; or &quot;ponds,&quot; which are persistently covered with\\r\\nwater. Please note, as there are no known naturally occurring lakes in the\\r\\nRegion, the previous class called Lakes (Code 52) has been dropped from the\\r\\nclassification system.

Wetland polygons were delineated at a scale of 1:6,000 using the CIR\\r\\nimagery after all other landcover delineations had been made at 1:14,000,\\r\\nmostly with the true color imagery. The NWI data was used as the primary\\r\\n&quot;backcoverage&quot; in ARC/Info for reference to wetland boundary and\\r\\nclassification information. This information was concurrently compared to USGS\\r\\ndigital raster graph (DRGs) topographic images which were viewed at the same\\r\\nscale in ArcView for reference to contours, hydrography, and other topographic\\r\\ninformation.

These zones are used by FEMA to designate the SFHA and for insurance rating purposes.  These data are the regulatory flood zones designated by FEMA.This map layer\\xa0represents Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) data important for floodplain management, mitigation, and insurance activities for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL) data present the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The NFHL database is a subset of the information created for the Flood Insurance Studies (FIS) and serves as a means to archive a portion of the information collected during the FIS. The NFHL data incorporates Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) databases published by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The 100-year flood is referred to as the 1% annual exceedance probability flood, since it is a flood that has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any single year.The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The 1% annual chance (base flood) is the flood that has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any year. The Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) is the area subject to flooding by the 1% annual chance flood. Areas of Special Flood Hazard include Zones A, AE, AH, AO, AR, A99, D, V, VE, and X.The NFHL data are derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps, flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data where available. The NFHL data is available at State level. The data is updated on a monthly basis and FEMA is in the process of mapping all the flood zones and so some counties do not have complete data.100-Year Flood Zones(*Note: the data can only be viewed when zoomed in at the Counties or larger scale)Data Currency: 2011For more information:\\xa0FEMA Flood Map Service CenterTo learn more about flood zones:\\xa0Flood ZonesFor feedback please contact:\\xa0ArcGIScomNationalMaps@esri.comThumbnail image courtesy of\\xa0U.S. Geological Survey',\n",

During processing, the raw dataset was resampled to 12.5 meter pixel resolution, then classified using PCI Geomatica software which is a specialized software designed to manipulate space born imagery. The final output depicting the flooding boundary is available as a TIFF or Shapefile.Launched in November 1995, RADARSAT-1 was a Canadian-led project which provided useful information to both commercial and scientific users in such fields as disaster management, agriculture, cartography, hydrology, forestry, oceanography, ice studies and coastal monitoring. Equipped with a powerful synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instrument, it acquired images of the Earth day or night, in all weather and through cloud cover, smoke and haze. As of March 2013, the satellite was declared non-operational and is no longer collecting data.Many applications were developed to take advantage of RADARSAT-1 capacity for detecting the presence of water. These included monitoring flooding and the build-up of river ice, and mapping the melting of snow-covered areas. When used for flood monitoring, RADARSAT-1 data helped assess the impact of flooding, predicted the extent and duration of floodwaters, analyzed the environmental impact of water diversion projects, and developed flood mitigation measures.Fields Included:FID: Internal feature numberNAME: Flooded area nameAREA_SQKM: Size of flooded area',\n",

Beginning in 1998, the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, began a cooperative project aimed at collecting, archiving, and entering into standardized electronic formats, the wealth of information generated by fisheries resource management agencies and tribes throughout California.Extensive data are currently available for chinook, coho, and steelhead. Major data categories include adult abundance population estimates, actual fish and/or carcass counts, counts of fish collected at dams, weirs, or traps, and redd counts. Harvest data has been compiled for many streams, and hatchery return data has been compiled for the states mitigation facilities. A draft format has been developed for juvenile abundance and awaits final approval. This CalFish Abundance Database shapefile was generated from fully routed 1:100,000 hydrography. In a few cases streams had to be added to the hydrography dataset in order to provide a means to create shapefiles to represent abundance data associated with them. Streams added were digitized at no more than 1:24,000 scale based on stream line images portrayed in 1:24,000 Digital Raster Graphics (DRG).These features generally represent abundance counts resulting from stream surveys. The linear features in this layer typically represent the location for which abundance data records apply. This would be the reach or length of stream surveyed, or the stream sections for which a given population estimate applies. In some cases the actual stream section surveyed was not specified and linear features represent the entire stream. In many cases there are multiple datasets associated with the same length of stream, and so, linear features overlap. Please view the associated datasets for detail regarding specific features. In CalFish these are accessed through the \"link\" that is visible when performing an identify or query operation. A URL string is provided with each feature in the downloadable data which can also be used to access the underlying datasets.The coho data that is available via the CalFish website is actually linked directly to the StreamNet website where the database\\'\\'s tabular data is currently stored.

After the project assessment risk and treatment ranking are identified for each stand, the next stage in the project analysis process is to combine these results and provide a score that represents the relative priority for each treatment. These scores were calculated according to the following steps:General guidance on appropriate treatment application – based on the assessment risk – is provided in the Treatment Application Matrix below. This matrix provides the model with direction on whether the treatment should be avoided, promoted, or is neutral. There are certainly exceptions to these directions that could produce alternative scoring scenario.The model uses the direction from the step above to determine the appropriate section of the priority scoring matrix, which basically provides a different scoring table for each direction.A preliminary priority score is then determined according to the assessment risk rating and the treatment rank (e.g., ARR of high (orange) with TR of 2 where the treatment is promoted yields a score of 8).The preliminary priority score for each treatment and assessment combination is then multiplied by the assessment weight given in the Treatment Application Matrix.\\xa0The final priority score is the sum of all preliminary scores factored by assessment weights (i.e., treatment scores).To simplify the presentation of the final results, the final priority scores were grouped into four area-based classes that reflect the general treatment priorities: very high, high, moderate, and low.\\xa0Treatment Application MatrixAssessment TypeRehab MPB StandsRehab Fire StandsEROpen ForestEROpen RangeThin Dry-Belt FirThin Repress PineEnhancedBasicSilvWeightOld seral stageNeutralNeutralPromotePromotePromotePromotePromote1.6Mature + Old seral stageAvoidAvoidAvoidAvoidPromotePromotePromote1.4Road DensityAvoidAvoidAvoidAvoidNeutralNeutralPromote1.0Stream Crossing DensityAvoidAvoidAvoidAvoidNeutralNeutralPromote1.0Road Density near StreamsAvoidAvoidAvoidAvoidNeutralNeutralPromote1.0Roads on Unstable SlopesAvoidAvoidAvoidAvoidNeutralNeutralPromote1.0Peak Flow Index ClassAvoidAvoidAvoidAvoidNeutralNeutralPromote1.3Moose Habitat RiskPromotePromotePromotePromotePromotePromotePromote1.3Marten Habitat RiskAvoidAvoidPromotePromotePromotePromotePromote1.3Wildfire RiskPromotePromotePromotePromoteAvoidAvoidAvoid1.3',\n",

It was derived from the 1:24,000-scale USGS Digital Line Graphs (DLGs).Purpose:These data may be used to construct municipal, regional, or statewide base maps.Supplemental_Information:Data distribution tile: statewideIn ARCE format, the coverage is a combined polygon and line coverage. In shapefile format, the two data types are written separately to PBP (polygon) and PBA (line) shapefiles.This data is not be used as a legal definition of town boundaries in the state.Time_Period_of_Content:Time_Period_Information:Range_of_Dates/Times:Beginning_Date: 19530101Ending_Date: 20130411Currentness_Reference: Publication DateStatus:Progress: CompleteMaintenance_and_Update_Frequency: IrregularSpatial_Domain:Bounding_Coordinates:West_Bounding_Coordinate: -72.5947East_Bounding_Coordinate: -70.6647North_Bounding_Coordinate: 45.3034South_Bounding_Coordinate: 42.6936Keywords:Theme:Theme_Keyword_Thesaurus: NoneTheme_Keyword: BoundaryTheme_Keyword: PoliticalTheme_Keyword: StateTheme_Keyword: CountyTheme_Keyword: TownTheme_Keyword: Digital Line GraphsPlace:Place_Keyword_Thesaurus: NonePlace_Keyword: United StatesPlace_Keyword: NortheastPlace_Keyword: New EnglandPlace_Keyword: New HampshireAccess_Constraints: NoneUse_Constraints: Not for legal usePoint_of_Contact:Contact_Information:Contact_Organization_Primary:Contact_Organization: Complex Systems Research CenterContact_Person: GRANIT Database ManagerContact_Position: GRANIT Database ManagerContact_Address:Address_Type: mailing and physical addressAddress: Morse Hall, University of New HampshireCity: DurhamState_or_Province: NHPostal_Code: 03824Country: USContact_Voice_Telephone: 603-862-1792Contact_Facsimile_Telephone: 603-862-0188Contact_Electronic_Mail_Address: granit@unh.eduHours_of_Service: 8:30AM-5PM, ESTBrowse_Graphic:Browse_Graphic_File_Name:&lt;URL:http://www.granit.sr.unh.edu/cgi-bin/load_file?PATH=/data/database/d-webdata/pb/browse.gif&gt;Browse_Graphic_File_Description: gif image fileBrowse_Graphic_File_Type: gifData_Set_Credit: GRANIT databaseNative_Data_Set_Environment:Arc/Info coverage formatData_Quality_Information:Attribute_Accuracy:Attribute_Accuracy_Report:The primary attribute associated with each polygon is the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which was generated directly from the DLGs.

Line topology was constructed, and attributes were appended using standard Arc/Info utilities. Each tile was then projected from UTM meters (Zone 18 or 19), NAD27, to NH State Plane feet, NAD83. The individual tiles were then edgematched, allowing for movement of arcs at the quadrangle seams of up to 10 ft. to create the statewide layer.Source_Used_Citation_Abbreviation: DLG-3Process_Date: 19920101Source_Produced_Citation_Abbreviation: Version 1Process_Contact:Contact_Information:Contact_Person_Primary:Contact_Organization: Complex Systems Research CenterContact_Person: GRANIT Database ManagerContact_Position: GRANIT Database ManagerContact_Address:Address_Type: mailing and physical addressAddress: Morse Hall, University of New HampshireCity: DurhamState_or_Province: NHPostal_Code: 03824Country: USContact_Voice_Telephone: 603-862-1792Contact_Facsimile_Telephone: 603-862-0188Contact_Electronic_Mail_Address: granit@unh.eduHours_of_Service: 8:30AM-5PM, ESTProcess_Step:Process_Description:The RPA (Regional Planning Agency) designation for 3 towns -

As new satellite imagery becomes available, NRCan will extract flood extent polygons and update the dataset in near real time (4 hours). This item contains the latest flood products generated in the past three days.  For any data older than 72 hours, please refer to the Floods in Canada - Current Year entry.\\n \\nThe flood products are generated and validated on a best effort basis.  Various factors may affect the quality of the flood polygons.  Those factors include but are not limited to: sensor type, image resolution, cloud coverage or limits to the flood polygon extraction method.  In this layer, a symbology is applied to the flood polygons based on the underlying land use classification, when available, or is simply unclassified and shows the gross flood extent otherwise.  Filter on dates and Area of Interest (AOI) to view specific products.  Time-enabled on Date UTC field.  \".zip\" file packages that contain the shapefile, PDF map, and \".kmz\" of individual product items are available through the FTP links listed in the Package URL field.\\n\\nDisclaimer:\\nEmergency response authorities are the primary users of these satellite-derived open water flood extent map products. These products are generated to provide analysis and emergency response situational awareness and to facilitate decision-making during major flood events. The open water flood extent products are generated rapidly and limited time is available for editing and validation. The flood products reflect the open water flood conditions at the date/time of acquisition. While efforts are made to produce high quality products, near-real time products may contain errors due to the limited time available for vector editing and validation.

Watershed Boundary data for this was provided by the USGS National Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). From USGS:\\xa0“WBD provides a uniquely identified and uniform method of subdividing large drainage areas. The data is intended to be used as a tool for water-resource management and planning activities, particularly for site-specific and localized studies requiring a level of detail provided by large-scale map information. The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) defines the areal extent of surface water drainage to a point, accounting for all land and surface areas. Watershed Boundaries are determined solely upon science-based hydrologic principles, not favoring any administrative boundaries or special projects, nor particular program or agency. The intent of defining Hydrologic Units (HU) for the Watershed Boundary Dataset is to establish a baseline drainage boundary framework, accounting for all land and surface areas. At a minimum, the WBD is being delineated and georeferenced to the USGS 1:24,000 scale topographic base map meeting National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). Hydrologic units are given a Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC). For example, a hydrologic region has a 2-digit HUC. A HUC describes where the unit is in the country and the level of the unit. The document &quot;Federal Standards and Procedures for the National Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD)&quot; can be found\\xa0here. ‘A hydrologic unit is a drainage area delineated to nest in a multi-level, hierarchical drainage system. Its boundaries are\\xa0defined by hydrographic and topographic criteria that delineate an area of land upstream from a specific point on a river, stream or similar surface waters. A hydrologic unit can accept surface water directly from upstream drainage areas, and indirectly from associated surface areas such as remnant, non-contributing, and diversions to form a drainage area with single or multiple outlet points. Hydrologic units are only synonymous with classic watersheds when their boundaries include all the source area contributing surface water to a single defined outlet point.’”\\xa0Original metadata.<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\n16.5pt;background:white'><p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\n16.5pt;background:white'>Private Water Districts:\\xa0Sierra Water\\r\\nWorkgroup has modified this layer of private water district boundaries in the\\r\\nTahoe-Sierra Watershed Region.

Data used to create these layers were largely sourced from CA EPA, CALFIRE/CALWATER, and the USDA Forest Service Pacific Southwest Region, among other data sources specifically cited. Data layers were created by Kate Gladstein of the Sierra Water Workgroup.Mine Resources:\\xa0This layer depicts metal and non-metal mineral resources within the\\xa0Tahoe-Sierra\\xa0IRWM region.\\xa0This dataset includes locations of mineral occurrence, past and current mineral\\xa0producing sites, prospecting sites, and mineral processing plants. This database contains the records previously provided in the Mineral Resource Data System (MRDS) of USGS and the Mineral Availability System/Mineral Industry Locator System (MAS/MILS) originated in the U.S. Bureau of Mines, which is now part of USGS, and data was modified by\\xa0Sierra Water Workgroup for the IRWM Project Management Application.\\xa0The MRDS is a large and complex relational database developed over several decades by hundreds of researchers and reporters. This product is a digest in which the fields chosen are those most likely to contain valid information.\\xa0Original Metadata.Data published in 2005 and updated in 2016.\\xa0Vegetation Burn Severity (% change in basal area):\\xa0This layer depicts vegetation burn severity calibrated to percent change in basal area for selected fires in the\\xa0Tahoe-Sierra\\xa0IRWM region.\\xa0Data\\xa0was provided by the USDA Forest Service fire and fuels monitoring project to support monitoring of wildland fire and fire regimes. These data will allow better understanding of current fire regimes, improve the accuracy of fire perimeter data, and add spatial data on fire severity and complexity. Data was then modified by the Sierra Water Workgroup for use in the TS IRWM Project Management Application.\\xa0Original Metadata.Data publish date: 2014\\xa0Land &amp; Resource Management Plan: Land Suitability Class:\\xa0This layer is used to track capable, available and suitable forest lands as required by the National Forest Management Act, within the\\xa0Tahoe-Sierra\\xa0IRWM region. Data was sourced by the USDA Forest Service and modified by the Sierra Water Workgroup.\\xa0Original Metadata.This is a derived layer of forestland capability, suitability and availability for timber production. Water is assigned census or non-census water using the water bodies layer. Land is assigned to forest or non-forest using existing vegetation. Forestland both capable (productive) and other (non-productive) forestland, as well as non-forest are determined by CALVEG types (TABLE 38). \\xa0Each CALVEG type is assigned a forest productivity code (TABLE 43). Suitability information is derived from productive forest CALVEG types that are available, minus the unsuitable forestlands (UNSU). Availability (TABLE 11) is derived by determining all forestland from CALVEG type, minus the congressionally withdrawn and pending withdrawal wilderness areas (WILD) and wild and scenic rivers (WSRR). For all lands that are tentatively suitable for timber production, a determination of final forestland allocations under the Forest Plan is made, using all prescription and management layers with a constraint on timber management assigned by the LSC code(s) on each layer (TABLE 29). The most constraining resource is coded for each acre on the National Forest. Deriving LSC final timberland allocation can be shown in a flow chart (LSC Chart).For more information about the Land and Resource Management Plan Areas, please see the USDA Forest Service websites:\\xa0http://www.fs.usda.gov/main/r5/landmanagement\\xa0Federal and State Land Ownership:\\xa0This layer illustrates the location of Federal and State managed lands in the\\xa0Tahoe-Sierra\\xa0IRWM region.

The focus of the data development efforts are on accurately depicting the locations of BLM managed lands. Private and non-governmental lands are labeled unclassified. Other Federal agencies, the State of California, and numerous County governments contribute much of the information and data incorporated into this geodatabase.\\xa0Original Metadata.Published April 2014.\\xa0National and State Parks:\\xa0This layer presents National Parks, National Forests, State Parks, and State Forests within the Tahoe-Sierra IRWM region.

Unlike CalEnviroScreen 1.0, Version 2.0 scores do not include a measure of race/ethnicity in the calculation of the CalEnviroScreen score.&quot; (http://oehha.ca.gov/ej/pdf/CES20RaceEthnicity_05082014.pdf) &quot;CalEnviroscreen 2.0 is the latest iteration of the CalEnviroScreen tool. It uses the same methodology as Version 1.1 except that the two indicators for drinking water and unemployment have been added, and the tool looks at pollution burdens and vulnerabilities in census tracts rather than ZIP codes. The two new indicators incorporate potential burdens to communities posed by contaminants in drinking water and potential social stressors relating to unemployment. The use of census tracts as the geographic scale may allow for a more precise screening of pollution burdens and vulnerabilities in communities. While race and ethnicity will not be used in compiling a score using CalEnviroScreen, the final CalEnviroScreen 2.0 document will contain a section that provides information on the racial and ethnic composition of communities throughout the state.

       "  'dc_description_s': \"This feature layer, utilizing data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), displays all operating surface and underground coal mines in the U.S. by total production in short tons. Many U.S. Coal deposits, called coal beads or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground. About two-thirds of U.S. coal production comes from surface mines. Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves. There are two primary methods of removing coal from the ground:Surface mining is often used when coal is less than 200 feet underground. In surface mining, the topsoil and rock layers are removed to uncover the coal seams. There is also a method of surface mining called mountaintop removal. This method uses dynamite to remove the tops of mountains with the waste removed to access the coal seams. Once the coal is removed the disturbed area is covered with topsoil and planted with grass and trees. Surface mining produces most of the coal in the United States because surface mining is less expensive than underground mining.Underground mining also called deep mining, is necessary when the coal seams are found hundreds of feet below the surface. Some underground mines are 1000 feet deep and can extend for many miles. Miners usually ride elevators and travel on small trains in long tunnels to mine the coal.In 2015, about 897 billion short tons of coal were produced in 25 U.S. States. Surface mines were the source of 66% of total U.S. coal production and accounted for 62% of the total number of mines. Five states accounted for approximately 71% of total U.S. coal production in 2015. They include: Wyoming - 41.9%, West Virginia - 10.7%, Kentucky - 6.8%, Illinois - 6.3% and Pennsylvania - 5.6%. Coal is mainly found in three regions of the United States:Appalachian Coal Region - This region includes the states of Alabama, Eastern Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. About 25% of the coal produced in the Unites States came from this region. The state of West Virginia is the largest coal producing state in this region, and the second largest coal producing state in the United States. Underground mines supplied 76% of the coal produced in the Appalachian Region.Interior Coal Region - This region includes the states of Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Western Kentucky. About 19% of total U.S. coal was mined in this region. Illinois was the largest coal producer in this region, accounting for 34% of the region's coal production and 6% of total U.S. coal production. Underground mines supplied 58% of the region's coal production and surface mines supplied 42%.Western Coal Region - This region includes the states of Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. About 57% of total U.S. coal production was mined in the Western Region. Wyoming produced 74% of the coal mined in the region and is the largest coal producing state in the U.S. Eight of the top ten producing coal mines in the U.S. were in Wyoming, and all those mines are surface mines. Surface mines produced 91% of the coal in the Western Coal Region.Surface and Underground Mines Total Production Short TonsData currency: 2015Data source:\\xa0MAPSFor more information, please visit:\\xa0Coal ExplainedFor feedback:\\xa0ArcGIScomNationalMaps@esri.comThumbnail source image courtesy of:\\xa0Max Phillips (Jeremy Buckingham MLC)Other Federal User Community federally focused content that may interest you\\xa0U.S. Department of Energy\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Energy Information Administration\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: USDOE\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: EIA\\xa0\",\n",

The locations and elevation values come from mainly from the RICA Maps of the Corpus Topographicum Pompeianum, vol. III. These are supplemented by locations and values from Eschebach and Müller-Trollius 1993, the Pompeii Archaeological Research Project: Porta Stabia (PARP:PS, http://classics.uc.edu/pompeii/), and Etani et al. (1998, 150, 2003, fig. 6; 129-33, figs. 6-11). Elevation points from PARP:PS and Etani et al. provide greater detail city blocks VIII.7 and  the Porta Stabia, and to the area of Tower 9, respectively. The elevation points from Eschebach are those that are not superseded by the greater precision of the RICA maps. These remaining Eschebach elevation point were rounded to the nearest decimeter, while those of the RICA maps are accurate to the nearest 5 centimeters. The locations of all elevation points were placed within a CAD file provided by the Soprintendenza di Pompei to Eric Poehler in 2003. The CAD file was created by digitizing the RICA Maps of Pompeii, 1984, supported by World Monuments Watch and funded by American Express. The RICA MAPs were drawn in part from aerial images taken at 820m and supplemented by on the ground survey. Inconsistencies among the features of this layer with satellite imagery or other maps of Pompeii may be the result of errors in the rectification of the original aerial images. On the creation of the RICA Maps, see Van der Poel, H. B., Corpus Topographicum Pompeianum, vol. IIIA.

The data covers all plants with a combined nameplate capacity of 1 MW (Megawatt) or more.In 2016, most U.S. electricity was generated using fossil fuels. The largest energy source in the U.S. generating 4 trillion kilowatt hours of electricity was natural gas. Natural gas was the source of about 34% of electric generation. The second largest energy source for electricity generation was coal with 30% of all power generation. Petroleum can be burned to produce electric generation, but this source is not a large source in power generation with less than 1% of U.S. electric generation. Nuclear power provided the U.S. with 1/5th of total U.S. electricity or about 20% of all U.S. electricity generation. Renewable energy sources provided 15% of total U.S. electricity in 2016. Hydropower generated 7% of total U.S. electricity generation and about 44% of electricity generation from renewable energy. Electricity generation from wind has increased significantly in the United States since 1970. In 2016, wind power provided almost 6% of U.S. electricity generation and about 37% of electricity generation from renewable energy.Biomass is a material derived from plants or animals and includes lumber, paper mill wastes, food scraps, grass, leaves and paper. Biomass can also include forestry and agricultural residues such as wood chips, corn cobs and wheat straw. However, Biomass has only accounted for 2% of the total U.S. electricity generation in 2016. Solar power produces energy from the sun and in 2016, generated about 1% of U.S. electricity generation. Geothermal power comes from heat energy beneath the surface of the earth. However, here again geothermal power generation was less than 1% of total U.S. electricity generation in 2016.Power PlantsData currency: June 26, 2017Data source:\\xa0MAPSFor more information, please visit:\\xa0Electricity - ExplainedFor feedback:\\xa0ArcGIScomNationalMaps@esri.comThumbnail source image courtesy of:\\xa0Jeanne MenjouletSymbology courtesy of the following\\xa0Noun Project\\xa0contributors:\\xa0Lisa Staudinger, Robert Beerwerth, Nikita Kozin, emilegraphics, Ron Scott, BomSymbols, Andrejs Kirma, Becris, Symbolon and IconathonOther Federal User Community federally focused content that may interest you\\xa0U.S. Department of Energy\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Energy Information Administration\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: USDOE\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: EIA\\xa0',\n",

This file is currently under construction and should be used for reference purposes only. \\n\\nData History: The attribute data for these features were derived from the catalog in Campbell 2015 (Appendix I, in The Tombs of Pompeii. Organization, Space, and Society. New York: Routledge) and digitized in CAD by students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Information on each tomb were joined to the spatial representations, including concordance information, tomb type, building materials, chronology, and a summary of the basis for that chronology. Spatial data in this layer are based on a CAD file provided by the Soprintendenza di Pompei to Eric Poehler in 2003. The CAD file was created by digitizing the RICA Maps of Pompeii, 1984, supported by World Monuments Watch and funded by American Express. The RICA MAPs were drawn in part from aerial images taken at 820m and supplemented by on the ground survey. Inconsistencies among the features of this layer with satellite imagery or other maps of Pompeii may be the result of errors in the rectification of the original aerial images and differences projected between coordinate systems (PBMP data are in the Monte_Mario_Italy_2 projected coordinate system). On the creation of the RICA Maps, see Van der Poel, H. B., Corpus Topographicum Pompeianum, vol. IIIA. Austin, TX, 1986, XI-XIX.\\n\\nSymbologies: This feature class is symbolized as a solid pink (Ginger pink) polygon, with 40% display transparency, and scale visibility set to not above 1:10,000.\\n\\nCredits: This data was produced by Eric Poehler for the Pompeii Bibliography and Mapping Project after original CAD data provided by the Soprintendenza di Pompei.\\n',\n",

Beginning in 1998, the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, began a cooperative project aimed at collecting, archiving, and entering into standardized electronic formats, the wealth of information generated by fisheries resource management agencies and tribes throughout California.Extensive data are currently available for chinook, coho, and steelhead. Major data categories include adult abundance population estimates, actual fish and/or carcass counts, counts of fish collected at dams, weirs, or traps, and redd counts. Harvest data has also been compiled for many streams.This CalFish Abundance Database shapefile was generated from fully routed 1:100,000 hydrography. In a few cases streams had to be added to the hydrography dataset in order to provide a means to create shapefiles to represent abundance data associated with them. Streams added were digitized at no more than 1:24,000 scale based on stream line images portrayed in 1:24,000 Digital Raster Graphics (DRG).These features represent abundance information resulting from counts at weirs, fish ladders, or other point-type monitoring protocols such as beach seining. The point features in this layer typically represent the location for which abundance data records apply. In many cases there are multiple datasets associated with the same point location, and so, point features overlap. Please view the associated datasets for detail regarding specific features. In CalFish these are accessed through the \"link\" field that is visible when performing an identify or query operation. A URL string is provided with each feature in the downloadable data which can also be used to access the underlying datasets.The coho data that is available via the CalFish website is actually linked directly to the StreamNet website where the database\\'\\'s tabular data is currently stored.

       "  'dc_description_s': 'The dataset \\'\\'ds180_Chinook_pnts\\'\\' is a product of the CalFish Adult Salmonid Abundance Database. Data in this shapefile are collected from point features, such as dams and hatcheries. Some escapement monitoring locations, such as spawning stock surveys, are logically represented by linear features. See the companion linear feature shapefile \\'\\'ds181_Chinook_ln\\'\\' for information collected from stream reaches.The CalFish Abundance Database contains a comprehensive collection of anadromous fisheries abundance information. Beginning in 1998, the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, began a cooperative project aimed at collecting, archiving, and entering into standardized electronic formats, the wealth of information generated by fisheries resource management agencies and tribes throughout California.The data format provides for sufficient detail to convey the relative accuracy of each population trend index record yet is simple and straight forward enough to be suited for public use. For those interested in more detail the database offers hyperlinks to digital copies of the original documents used to compile the information. In this way the database serves as an information hub directing the user to additional supporting information. This offers utility to field biologists and others interested in obtaining information for more in-depth analysis. Hyperlinks, built into the spatial data attribute tables used in the BIOS and CalFish I-map viewers, open the detailed index data archived in the on-line CalFish database application. The information can also be queried directly from the database via the CalFish Tabular Data Query. Once the detailed annual trend data are in view, another hyperlink opens a digital copy of the document used to compile each record.During 2010, as a part of the Central Valley Chinook Comprehensive Monitoring Plan, the CalFish Salmonid Abundance Database was reorganized and updated. CalFish provides a central location for sharing Central Valley Chinook salmon escapement estimates and annual monitoring reports to all stakeholders, including the public. Annual Chinook salmon in-river escapement indices that were, in many cases, eight to ten years behind are now current though 2009. In some cases, multiple datasets were consolidated into a single, more comprehensive, dataset to more closely reflect how data are reported in the California Department of Fish and Game standard index, Grandtab.Extensive data are currently available in the CalFish Abundance Database for California Chinook, coho, and steelhead. Major data categories include adult abundance population estimates, actual fish and/or carcass counts, counts of fish collected at dams, weirs, or traps, and redd counts. Harvest data has also been compiled for many streams.This CalFish Abundance Database shapefile was generated from fully routed 1:100,000 hydrography. In a few cases streams had to be added to the hydrography dataset in order to provide a means to create shapefiles to represent abundance data associated with them. Streams added were digitized at no more than 1:24,000 scale based on stream line images portrayed in 1:24,000 Digital Raster Graphics (DRG).The features in this layer represent the location for which abundance data records apply. In many cases there are multiple datasets associated with the same location, and so, features may overlap. Please view the associated datasets for detail regarding specific features. In CalFish these are accessed through the \"link\" field that is visible when performing an identify or query operation. A URL string is provided with each feature in the downloadable data which can also be used to access the underlying datasets.The Chinook data that is available from the CalFish website is actually mirrored from the StreamNet website where the CalFish Abundance Database\\'\\'s tabular data is currently stored. Additional information about StreamNet may be downloaded at http://www.streamnet.org. Complete documentation for the StreamNet database may be accessed at http://http://www.streamnet.org/def.html',\n",

The primary sources used to derive this impervious layer were 2013 LiDAR data, 2013 Ortho imagery and 2012 NAIP imagery. Ancillary data sources included GIS data provided by Lake County or created by the UVM Spatial Analysis Laboratory. This impervious dataset is considered current as of Summer, 2013. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract impervious information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. Following the automated OBIA mapping a detailed manual review of the dataset was carried out at a scale of 1:2,500 and all observable errors were corrected.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 DISCLAIMER The\\n data on this website is provided 'as is' without warranty of accuracy, \\ntimeliness or completeness.

Although it has a landuse component which is used for forecasts and modeling at ARC, outside users should be aware that the landcover and landuse delineations are based on photo-interpretation of a 5-acre and 25-acre minimum mapping unit respectively, not parcels. Likewise, LandPro2005 should not be taken out of its Regional context, though county-level or municipal-level analysis may be useful for transportation, environmental and landuse planning. LandPro2005 is ARC's landuse/landcover GIS database for the 20-county Atlanta Region (Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry, Rockdale, the EPA non-attainment (1hr standard) counties of Forsyth, Paulding and Coweta. and the EPA non-attainment (8hr standard) counties of Carroll, Barrow, Bartow, Hall, Newton, Spalding and Walton). LandPro2005 was created by on-screen photo-interpretation and digitizing of ortho-rectified aerial photography at a scale of 1:14,000. The primary source for this GIS database was 2005 true color imagery with 1.64-foot pixel resolution, provided by Aerials Express, Inc.Though\\r\\nthe terms are often used interchangeably, landuse and landcover are not\\r\\nsynonymous.\\xa0 Landcover generally refers\\r\\nto the natural or cultivated vegetation, rock, or water covering the land, as\\r\\nwell as the developed surface which can be identified on aerial\\r\\nphotography.\\xa0 Landuse generally refers to\\r\\nthe way that humans use or will use the land, regardless of its apparent\\r\\nlandcover.\\xa0 Collateral data for the\\r\\nlandcover mapping effort included the Aero Surveys of Georgia street atlas, the\\r\\nGeorgia Department of Community Affairs (DCA) Community Facilities database and\\r\\nthe USGS Digital Raster Graphics (DRGs) of 1:24,000 scale topographic maps.\\xa0 The landuse component of this database was\\r\\nadded after the landcover interpretation was completed, and is based primarily\\r\\non ownership information provided by the 20 counties and the City of Atlanta\\r\\nfor larger tracts of undeveloped land that meet the landuse definition of\\r\\n&quot;Extensive Institutional&quot; or &quot;Park Lands&quot; (refer to the\\r\\nCode Descriptions and Discussion section below).\\xa0 Although some of the boundaries of these\\r\\ntracts may align with visible features from the aerial photography, these areas\\r\\nare generally &quot;non-photo-identifiable,&quot; thus require other sources\\r\\nfor accurate identification.\\xa0 The minimum\\r\\nmapping unit standard for this database is generally 5 acres, with varying\\r\\nexceptions based on category and context.\\xa0\\r\\nSome smaller Intensive Institutional (mostly elementary schools),\\r\\nCommercial, Cemeteries, and Reservoirs (impoundments) have been intentionally\\r\\ndelineated in some cases throughout the Region.\\xa0\\r\\nWithin the downtown and midtown areas, many small polygons of\\r\\nmulti-family residential have been identified and added with the 2003 update\\r\\nand expanded upon in the 2005 update through research of mostly web-based\\r\\nresources.\\xa0 Within single-family\\r\\nneighborhoods, differentiation of adjacent residential areas (111-low density,\\r\\n112-medium density, and 113-high density) is generally 25 acres, and within\\r\\nagricultural areas, delineation of some forested areas (Code 40) is\\r\\noccasionally larger.\\xa0 25 acres is also\\r\\nthe minimum mapping consideration for the landuse categories of Extensive\\r\\nInstitutional (Code 125) and Park Lands (Code 175).\\xa0 The landuse/cover classification system is\\r\\nadapted from the USGS (Anderson) classification system, incorporating a mix of\\r\\nlevel I, II and III classes.\\xa0 There are a\\r\\ntotal of 25 categories in ARC's landuse/cover system (described below), 2 of\\r\\nwhich are used only for landuse designations: Park Lands (Code 175) and\\r\\nExtensive Institutional (Code 125).\\xa0 The\\r\\nother 23 categories can describe landuse and/or landcover, and in most cases\\r\\nwill be the same.\\xa0 The LU code will\\r\\ndiffer from the LC code only where the Park Lands (Code 175) and Extensive\\r\\nInstitutional (Code 125) land holdings have been identified from collateral\\r\\nsources of land ownership.Although\\r\\nsimilar to previous eras of ARC landuse/cover databases developed before 1999\\r\\n(1995, 1990 etc.), &quot;LandPro&quot; differs in many significant ways.\\r\\nOriginally, ARC's landuse and landcover database was built from 1975 data\\r\\ncomplied by USGS at scales of 1:100,000 and selectively, 1:24,000.\\xa0 The coverage was updated in 1990 using SPOT\\r\\nsatellite imagery and low-altitude aerial photography and again in 1995 using\\r\\n1:24,000 scale panchromatic aerial photography.\\xa0\\r\\nUnlike these previous 5-year updates, the 1999, 2001' 2003 and now 2005\\r\\nLandPro databases were compiled at a larger scale (1:14,000) and do not\\r\\ndirectly reflect pre-1999 delineations.\\xa0\\r\\nIn addition, all components of LandPro were produced using digital\\r\\northophotos for on-screen photo-interpretation and digitizing, thus eliminating\\r\\nthe use of unrectified photography and the need for data transfer and board\\r\\ndigitizing.\\xa0 As a result, the positional\\r\\naccuracy of LandPro is much higher than in previous eras.\\xa0 There have also been some changes to the\\r\\nclassification system prior to 1999.\\xa0\\r\\nPreviously, three categories of Forest (41-deciduous, 42-coniferous, and\\r\\n43-mixed forest) were used; this version does not distinguish between\\r\\nconiferous and deciduous forest, thus Code 40 is used to simply designate\\r\\nForest.\\xa0 Likewise, two categories of\\r\\nWetlands (61-forested wetland, and 62-non-forested wetland) were used before;\\r\\nthis version does not distinguish between forested and non-forested wetlands,\\r\\nthus Code 60 is used to simply designate Wetlands.\\xa0 With regard to Wetlands, the boundaries\\r\\nthemselves are now based on the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) delineations\\r\\nalong with the CIR imagery.\\xa0 Furthermore,\\r\\nCode 51 has been renamed &quot;Rivers&quot; from &quot;Streams and Canals&quot;\\r\\nand represents the Chattahoochee and Etowah Rivers which haav been identified\\r\\nin the landuse/cover database.\\xa0 In\\r\\naddition to these changes, Code 52 has been dropped from the system as there\\r\\nare no known instances of naturally occurring lakes in the Region. Finally, the\\r\\nlanduse code for Park Lands has been changed from 173 to 175 so as to minimize\\r\\nconfusion with the Parks landcover code, 173.\\xa0\\r\\nThere has been a change in the agriculture classification for\\r\\nLandPro2005.\\xa0 Previously, four catagories\\r\\nof agriculture (21- agriculture-cropland and pasture, 22 - agriculture -\\r\\norchards, 23 - agriculture - confined feeding operations and 24 - agriculture -\\r\\nothre) were used; this version does not distinguish between the different\\r\\nagricultural lands.\\xa0 Code 20 is now used\\r\\nto designate agriclture. Due to new technology and the enhancements to this\\r\\ndatabase, direct comparison between LandPro99, LandPro2001, LandPro2003 and\\r\\nlandPro2005 is now possible, with the 1999 database serving as ARC's new\\r\\nbaseline.\\xa0 Please note that as a result\\r\\nof the 2003 mapping effort, LandPro2001 has been adjusted for better comparison\\r\\nto LandPro2003 and is named &quot;LandPro01_adj.&quot;\\xa0 Lilkewise, LandPro99 was previously adjusted\\r\\nwhen LandPro2001 was completed, but was not further adjusted following the 2003\\r\\nupdate.\\xa0 Although some adjustments were\\r\\noriginally made to the 1995 landuse/cover database for modeling applications,\\r\\ndirect comparisons to previous versions of ARC landuse/cover before 1999 should\\r\\nbe avoided in most cases.\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'>Classification\\r\\nSystem:<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'>111:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Low Density Single Family Residential -\\r\\nAreas that have generally been developed for single family residential use,\\r\\nusually with a significant mix of forested or agricultural landcover.\\xa0 These areas often occur on the periphery of\\r\\nurban expansion and are generally characterized by houses on 2 to 5 acre\\r\\nlots.\\xa0 Some examples of this category\\r\\ninclude rural housing, estates, and linear residential developments along\\r\\ntransportation routes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'>112:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Medium Density Single Family Residential -\\r\\nAreas that have predominantly been developed for single family residential use,\\r\\nwith or without a significant mix of forested or agricultural landcover.\\xa0 These areas usually occur in urban or\\r\\nsuburban zones and are generally characterized by houses on 1/4 to 2 acre\\r\\nlots.\\xa0 This category accounts for the\\r\\nmajority of residential landuse in the Region and includes a wide variety of\\r\\nneighborhood types.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'>113:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 High Density Residential - Areas that have\\r\\npredominantly been developed for concentrated single family residential\\r\\nuse.\\xa0 These areas occur almost\\r\\nexclusively in urban neighborhoods with streets on a grid network, and are\\r\\ncharacterized by houses on lots smaller than 1/4 acre, but may also include\\r\\nmixed residential areas with duplexes and small apartment buildings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'>117:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Multifamily Residential - Residential areas\\r\\ncomprised predominantly of apartment, condominium and townhouse complexes where\\r\\nnet density generally exceeds eight units per acre.\\xa0 Typical apartment buildings are relatively\\r\\neasy to identify, but some high rise structures may be interpreted as, or\\r\\ncombined with, office buildings, though many of these dwellings were identified\\r\\nand delineated in downtown and midtown for the first time with the 2003 update.\\xa0 Likewise, some smaller apartments and\\r\\ntownhouses may be interpreted as, or combined with, medium- or high-density\\r\\nsingle family residential.\\xa0 Housing on\\r\\nmilitary bases, campuses, resorts, agricultural properties and construction\\r\\nwork sites is not included in this or other residential categories.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'>119:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mobile Home Parks - Areas that have been\\r\\ndeveloped for single family mobile home use.

Each MOE is expressed in the same units as its corresponding measure;\\nfor example, if the estimate value is expressed as a number, then its MOE will\\nalso be a number; if the estimate value is expressed as a percent, then its MOE\\nwill also be a percent.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe user should also note that for relatively\\nsmall geographic areas, such as census tracts shown here, ACS only releases\\ncombined 5-year estimates, meaning these estimates represent rolling averages\\nof survey results that were collected over a 5-year span (in this case\\n2013-2017).\\xa0Therefore, these data do not represent any one specific point\\nin time or even one specific year.\\xa0For geographic areas with larger\\npopulations, 3-year and 1-year estimates are also available.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nFor further explanation of ACS estimates and margin of error,\\nvisit Census ACS website.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nNaming conventions:\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n<table border='0'

To begin this process we had to compile the individual Landsat images in order to have a unified image within the study area to perform an unsupervised classification.  After 50 unclassified classes were produced, we manually renamed each class as either being in an MTR area or not.  Reclassification of the image then produced a raster with two distinct classes.\\nIn order to acquire an area calculation, we needed to convert the raster to a polygon so acreage could be computed.  After the polygon was produced, select areas were removed from the layer.  These areas included buffers around roads and streams (which have similar spectral characteristics to MTR zones) and areas outside of mountain ridges zones (blasting only occurs on the mountain ridges so this is a search requirement).\\nThe analysis showed that there was 12,254 acres of MTR area in this Group 6 subset.  Accuracy was assessed at 86.7 percent by generating random points and validating their accuracy by visual comparison to the Landsat imagery.  The 2010 MTR acreage impacted was an increase of over 7,300 acres from the 2005 MTR area.\\n',\n",

       "  'dc_description_s': 'The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation\\'s surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.Selecting Only Major Rivers in the NHD using ArcMapfrom the USGS National Hydrography Dataset Newsletter, Vol. 13, No. 8, June 2014, by Jeff Simley, USGSThe NHD contains a lot of information, but for some applications, particularly those at small scales, it needs to be generalized. One approach is to show only “major rivers” in the NHD. A quick technique to show only the named rivers can easily be done by selecting NHDFlowline GNIS_NAME &gt; ‘0’. See: ftp://nhdftp.usgs.gov/Hydro_Images/BlueRiver_Named_Rivers.jpgTo be even more restrictive, major rivers can be defined as only “double-line” or polygonal rivers, which appear in NHDArea. This is more complicated, and takes a few minutes, but works well. This approach finds the Artifical Path of those polygonal rivers:1. Find the polygonal rivers: Select by Attributes NHDArea where FType = 460 - Stream/River.2. Now it is necessary to find the NHDFlowline Artificial Paths of those rivers. Artificial Paths are linked to the polygon they are inside of using the field WBArea_Permanent_Identier. Create the link by doing a relate between NHDFlowline (key WBArea_Permanent_Identifier) and NHDArea (key Permanent_Identifier)3. Invoke the relationship and select the corresponding NHDFlowlines.4. For clarity, turn off the NHDArea selected features (the polygonal rivers).5. Now the candidate artificial paths are selected, but there are two problems: One is that the rivers running through lakes are not selected (which they should be), and two, the “stubs”of the tributary artificial paths have been selected (which are not wanted). 6. Next order of business is to eliminate the minor stubs with no name. Select from selection by Attributes NHDFlowline GNIS_Name &gt; ‘0’. Now only stubs that are named remain. 7. Some of the remaining candidate artificial paths are wanted (the major rivers) and some are not (the named stubs). The named stubs can be eliminated by virtue of the fact that there are very few of them (normally one record per name) and those with low counts can be eliminated.8. Open the NHDFlowline attribute table. Some records are selected (the remaining candidate list) and some are not (all other flowlines making up “minor rivers”). Summarize the number of records under the field GNIS_Name and write this out as Sum_Output.dbf which you then add to ArcMap.9. Now the goal is to find the names of the major rivers. These will be rivers with a record count greater than 1. The extraneous non-named stubs have already been eliminated, which helps reduce the load. The next steps will select only records with significant counts, that is, the major rivers. This will allow deselecting the remaining NHDFlowlines and in the process eliminate the named stubs.10. It is necessary to relate Sum_Output (key GNIS_Name) with NHDFlowline (key GNIS_Name) to make it possible to use the GNIS_NAME’s to select the major rivers in NHDFlowline.11. Open the Sum_Output table. Note the field Count_GNIS_Name which will be used to count records. This will eliminate named stubs, leaving just the major rivers selected. Create a New Selection, Cnt_GNIS_N &gt; 1. Leave the table open. Note major rivers are selected.Invoke the relationship to select the major rivers. In ArcMap all “major rivers” have been selected, even rivers through lakes. See ftp://nhdftp.usgs.gov/Hydro_Images/Blue_River_Selected.jpg12. Select only those features with \"River\" in the GNIS Name.',\n",

       "  'dc_description_s': \"The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) conducts coastwide (including the Channel Islands) aerial surveys of giant and bull kelp. The first aerial survey was conducted in 1989, with another survey in 1999; annual surveys began in 2002. Although CDFW strives to complete surveys every year, some years and regions were not completed due to budget constraints.\\xa0Geographic Information Systems (GIS) link\\xa0opens in new window shapefiles of the aerial kelp surveys can be found on the CDFW website as well as on MarineBIOS, a CDFW marine and coastal map viewer.The 2008 dataset is used to assess the extent of kelp resources along the coast of California. The user should note this dataset was collected and created with a different camera system and software than the 2002-2007 surveys. This difference in camera system and processing software allows the collection of both surface and subsurface kelp with separate classification schemes. See associated layer file depicting the two seperate classifications. The shapefile was created from Digital Multi-Spectral Camera image files. This is public data. The data was collected and processed by Ocean Imaging under contract by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG). The California Department of Fish and Game must be credited with the distribution of these data. The dataset represents the 2008 CDFG survey. The Northern and Central California surveys were flown October 06-08, 2008. The Southern California including the Channel Islands imagery was acquired October 20-23, 2008. The photographs were taken from an altitude of 12,500 feet, utilizing the Department's Partenavia aircraft. Surveys were planned to coincide with periods of minimal change between high and low tides, to avoid strong tidal induced currents. This dataset is complete at this time, although the user should note omissions. The data are projected in California Teale Albers using North American Datum 1983.NOTE: File reindexed to match CDFW kelp administrative kelp bed boundaries modified by changes to California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Section 165, effective April 1, 2014The 2016 vector dataset is a thematic map representing mosaicked multi-spectral imagery, targeting both exposed and submerged kelp beds along the California coastline and Channel Islands. The imagery used to create this classification was acquired at a spatial resolution of 0.3 meters using a Microsoft UltraCam Eagle digital camera acquiring in the red, green, blue, and near-infrared bands. The image mosaic product used for the classification is a result of the resampling of the 0.3 meter data to 2 meter resolution. The data are projected in California Teale Albers using North American Datum 1983. Surface kelp canopy and subsurface kelp classifications are separate. The data was collected and processed by Sandoval &amp; Associates, LLC under contract by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). CDFW must be credited with the distribution of these data. The imagery was collected September 3-25, 2016. This dataset is complete at this time, although the user should note any omissions.DISCLAIMER The user is cautioned against making direct comparisons between the various kelp surveys for the following reasons: (1)Timing of the survey is important, particularly with respect to growing season, conditions in the ocean, storms, and harvest levels preceding the dates of imagery collection. Season variability may account for differences in surveys which may not reflect a change in the bed's extent, productivity, or harvest level. (2) Statisical significance in change of area should be evaluated. To do this, a variance parameter is needed, which is obtained by repeated measurements. (3) Survey methods may not be consistent. Some method of calibration between the methods should be performed in order to insure a change of area is not due to survey instrumentation and not misinterpreted as a biological change. (4) An area where no kelp data are present may represent an area devoid of kelp, or may represent an area where kelp was not detected due to poor photo quality, missing photo coverage, or other issues with data collection and processing. Image coverage is extensive for the state, but the user is advised to consult the supplementary information for each year to determine whether imagery were acquired for an area of interest.Explore the data using the\\xa0dashboard app!\",\n",

This boundary file has been reviewed by a variety of relevant professionals and can be considered acceptable for mapping at 1:24000. The original legal boundary maps obtained from the Delta Protection Commission were compiled by DWR Land &amp; Right of Way sometime in the early 1980s, with one revision made to the original maps in the vicinity of Point Pleasant.Additional notes: The exact accuracy is somewhat uncertain, but can be considered acceptable for mapping within 7.5 Minute USGS map accuracy standards (1:24000 scale). The original topographic maps containing the drawn Delta border were scanned from the Department of Water Resources. Images were registered to 1:24000 USGS DRG's in ArcView (ESRI) utilizing imagewarp extension. The Delta boundary was digitized from the registered images. The original legal boundary maps were based on the legal description in Section 12220 of the Water Code, with ambiguities in the Code addressed by the individuals involved in the mapping project at that time. One revision was made to the original maps in the vicinity of Point Pleasant, and is the only difference between this and the 4.2001 version of the legal Delta boundary Arc/INFO coverage.Published to DWR Spatial Data Library 2/21/2003.

The revision between the 4.2001 and the 4.2002 versions reflects a change in the vicinity of Point Pleasant in the east Delta, as shown on modified Delta Protection Commission maps. The line was moved south to the township boundary line, as appropriate, using ArcGIS 8.1 software. During 2001 &amp; early 2002 every effort was made to identify any errors in the underlying data sources, including water district, reclamation district, roads, etc. boundaries. While certain features were not able to be 100% certified, this coverage can be considered to be as accurate based on all of the information available at this time. These uncertainties principally involve obscurity in some of the ancestral source data.\",\n",

Each MOE is expressed in the same units as its corresponding measure; for example, if the estimate value is expressed as a number, then its MOE will also be a number; if the estimate value is expressed as a percent, then its MOE will also be a percent.\\xa0\\xa0The user should also note that for relatively small geographic areas, such as census tracts shown here, ACS only releases combined 5-year estimates, meaning these estimates represent rolling averages of survey results that were collected over a 5-year span (in this case 2013-2017).\\xa0Therefore, these data do not represent any one specific point in time or even one specific year.\\xa0For geographic areas with larger populations, 3-year and 1-year estimates are also available.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0For further explanation of ACS estimates and margin of error, visit\\xa0Census ACS website.\\xa0Naming conventions:\\xa0Prefixes:NoneCountpPercentrRatemMedianaMean (average)tAggregate (total)chChange in absolute terms (value in t2\\xa0- value in t1)pchPercent change ((value in t2\\xa0- value in t1) / value in t1)chpChange in percent (percent in t2\\xa0- percent in t1)Suffixes:NoneChange over two periods_eEstimate from most recent ACS_mMargin of Error from most recent ACS_00Decennial 2000\\xa0\\xa0Attributes:\\xa0SumLevelSummary level of geographic unit (e.g., County, Tract, NSA, NPU, DSNI, SuperDistrict, etc)GEOIDCensus tract Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) code\\xa0NAMEName of geographic unitPlanning_RegionPlanning region designation for ARC purposesAcresTotal area within the tract (in acres)SqMiTotal area within the tract (in square miles)CountyCounty identifier (combination of Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) codes for state and county)CountyNameCounty NameTotPop_e# Total population, 2017TotPop_m# Total population, 2017 (MOE)Hisp_e# Hispanic or Latino (of any race), 2017Hisp_m# Hispanic or Latino (of any race), 2017 (MOE)pHisp_e% Hispanic or Latino (of any race), 2017pHisp_m% Hispanic or Latino (of any race), 2017 (MOE)Not_Hisp_e# Not Hispanic or Latino, 2017Not_Hisp_m# Not Hispanic or Latino, 2017 (MOE)pNot_Hisp_e% Not Hispanic or Latino, 2017pNot_Hisp_m% Not Hispanic or Latino, 2017 (MOE)NHWhite_e# Not Hispanic, White alone, 2017NHWhite_m# Not Hispanic, White alone, 2017 (MOE)pNHWhite_e% Not Hispanic, White alone, 2017pNHWhite_m% Not Hispanic, White alone, 2017 (MOE)NHBlack_e# Not Hispanic, Black or African American alone, 2017NHBlack_m# Not Hispanic, Black or African American alone, 2017 (MOE)pNHBlack_e% Not Hispanic, Black or African American alone, 2017pNHBlack_m% Not Hispanic, Black or African American alone, 2017 (MOE)NH_AmInd_e# Not Hispanic, American Indian and Alaska Native alone, 2017NH_AmInd_m# Not Hispanic, American Indian and Alaska Native alone, 2017 (MOE)pNH_AmInd_e% Not Hispanic, American Indian and Alaska Native alone, 2017pNH_AmInd_m% Not Hispanic, American Indian and Alaska Native alone, 2017 (MOE)NH_Asian_e# Not Hispanic, Asian alone, 2017NH_Asian_m# Not Hispanic, Asian alone, 2017 (MOE)pNH_Asian_e% Not Hispanic, Asian alone, 2017pNH_Asian_m% Not Hispanic, Asian alone, 2017 (MOE)NH_PacIsl_e# Not Hispanic, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone, 2017NH_PacIsl_m# Not Hispanic, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone, 2017 (MOE)pNH_PacIsl_e% Not Hispanic, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone, 2017pNH_PacIsl_m% Not Hispanic, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone, 2017 (MOE)NH_OthRace_e# Not Hispanic, some other race alone, 2017NH_OthRace_m# Not Hispanic, some other race alone, 2017 (MOE)pNH_OthRace_e% Not Hispanic, some other race alone, 2017pNH_OthRace_m% Not Hispanic, some other race alone, 2017 (MOE)NH_TwoRace_e# Not Hispanic, two or more races, 2017NH_TwoRace_m# Not Hispanic, two or more races, 2017 (MOE)pNH_TwoRace_e% Not Hispanic, two or more races, 2017pNH_TwoRace_m% Not Hispanic, two or more races, 2017 (MOE)NH_AsianPI_e# Non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander, 2017NH_AsianPI_m# Non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander, 2017 (MOE)pNH_AsianPI_e% Non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander, 2017pNH_AsianPI_m% Non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander, 2017 (MOE)NH_Other_e# Non-Hispanic other (Native American, other one race, two or more races), 2017NH_Other_m# Non-Hispanic other (Native American, other one race, two or more races), 2017 (MOE)pNH_Other_e% Non-Hispanic other (Native American, other one race, two or more races), 2017pNH_Other_m% Non-Hispanic other (Native American, other one race, two or more races), 2017 (MOE)last_edited_dateLast date the feature was edited by ARC\\xa0Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Atlanta Regional CommissionDate: 2013-2017\\xa0For additional information, please visit the\\xa0Census ACS website.',\n",

The final output depicting the flooding boundary is available as a TIFF or Shapefile.Launched in November 1995, RADARSAT-1 was a Canadian-led project which provided useful information to both commercial and scientific users in such fields as disaster management, agriculture, cartography, hydrology, forestry, oceanography, ice studies and coastal monitoring. Equipped with a powerful synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instrument, it acquired images of the Earth day or night, in all weather and through cloud cover, smoke and haze. As of March 2013, the satellite was declared non-operational and is no longer collecting data.Many applications were developed to take advantage of RADARSAT-1 capacity for detecting the presence of water. These included monitoring flooding and the build-up of river ice, and mapping the melting of snow-covered areas. When used for flood monitoring, RADARSAT-1 data helped assess the impact of flooding, predicted the extent and duration of floodwaters, analyzed the environmental impact of water diversion projects, and developed flood mitigation measures.Fields Included:FID: Internal feature numberNAME: Flooded area nameAREA_SQKM: Size of flooded area',\n",

LandPro2012 should not be taken out of its regional context, though county-level or municipal-level analysis may be useful for transportation, environmental and land use planning. LandPro2012 is ARC's land use/land cover GIS database for the 21-county Atlanta Region (Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry, Rockdale, the EPA non-attainment (8hr standard) counties of Carroll, Coweta, Barrow, Bartow, Forsyth, Hall, Newton, Paulding, Spalding and Walton and Dawson which will become a part of the 2010 Urbanized Area). LandPro2012 was created by on-screen photo-interpretation and digitizing of ortho-rectified aerial photography. The primary source for this GIS database were the local parcels and the 2009 true color imagery with 1.64-foot pixel resolution, provided by Aerials Express, Inc. 2010 is the first year we have used parcel data to help more accurately delineate the LandPro categories.For ArcGIS 10 users: See full metadata by enabling FGDC metadata in ArcCatalog Customize &gt; ArcCatalog Options &gt; Metadata (tab)Though the terms are often used interchangeably, land use and land cover are not synonymous. Land cover generally refers to the natural or cultivated vegetation, rock, or water covering the land, as well as the developed surface which can be identified on aerial photography. Land use generally refers to the way that humans use or will use the land, regardless of its apparent land cover. Collateral data for the land cover mapping effort included the Aero Surveys of Georgia street atlas, the Georgia Department of Community Affairs (DCA) Community Facilities database and the USGS Digital Raster Graphics (DRGs) of 1:24,000 scale topographic maps. The land use component of this database was added after the land cover interpretation was completed, and is based primarily on ownership information provided by the 21 counties and the City of Atlanta for larger tracts of undeveloped land that meet the land use definition of &quot;Extensive Institutional&quot; or &quot;Park Lands&quot; (refer to the Code Descriptions and Discussion section below). Although some of the boundaries of these tracts may align with visible features from the aerial photography, these areas are generally &quot;non-photo-identifiable,&quot; thus require other sources for accurate identification. The land use/cover classification system is adapted from the USGS (Anderson) classification system, incorporating a mix of level I, II and III classes. There are a total of 25 categories in ARC's land use/cover system (described below), 2 of which are used only for land use designations: Park Lands (Code 175) and Extensive Institutional (Code 125). The other 23 categories can describe land use and/or land cover, and in most cases will be the same. The LU code will differ from the LC code only where the Park Lands (Code 175) and Extensive Institutional (Code 125) land holdings have been identified from collateral sources of land ownership.Although similar to previous eras of ARC land use/cover databases developed before 1999 (1995, 1990 etc.), &quot;LandPro&quot; differs in many significant ways. Originally, ARC's land use and land cover database was built from 1975 data compiled by USGS at scales of 1:100,000 and selectively, 1:24,000. The coverage was updated in 1990 using SPOT satellite imagery and low-altitude aerial photography and again in 1995 using 1:24,000 scale panchromatic aerial photography. Unlike these previous 5-year updates, the 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005 2007, 2008 and 2009 LandPro databases were compiled at a larger scale (1:14,000) and do not directly reflect pre-1999 delineations. In addition, all components of LandPro were produced using digital orthophotos for on-screen photo-interpretation and digitizing, thus eliminating the use of unrectified photography and the need for data transfer and board digitizing. As a result, the positional accuracy of LandPro is much higher than in previous eras. There have also been some changes to the classification system prior to 1999. Previously, three categories of Forest (41-deciduous, 42-coniferous, and 43-mixed forest) were used; this version does not distinguish between coniferous and deciduous forest, thus Code 40 is used to simply designate Forest. Likewise, two categories of Wetlands (61-forested wetland, and 62-non-forested wetland) were used before; this version does not distinguish between forested and non-forested wetlands, thus Code 60 is used to simply designate Wetlands. With regard to Wetlands, the boundaries themselves are now based on the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) delineations along with the CIR imagery. Furthermore, Code 51 has been renamed &quot;Rivers&quot; from &quot;Streams and Canals&quot; and represents the Chattahoochee and Etowah Rivers which have been identified in the land use/cover database. In addition to these changes, Code 52 has been dropped from the system as there are no known instances of naturally occurring lakes in the Region. Finally, the land use code for Park Lands has been changed from 173 to 175 so as to minimize confusion with the Parks land cover code, 173. There has been a change in the agriculture classification for LandPro2005 and any LandPro datasets hereafter. Previously, four categories of agriculture (21- agriculture-cropland and pasture, 22 - agriculture - orchards, 23 - agriculture - confined feeding operations and 24 - agriculture - other) were used; this version does not distinguish between the different agricultural lands. Code 20 is now used to designate agriculture. Due to new technology and the enhancements to this database, direct comparison between LandPro99, LandPro2001, LandPro2003 and landPro2005 and all successive updates are now possible, with the 1999 database serving as ARC's new baseline. Please note that as a result of the 2003 mapping effort, LandPro2001 has been adjusted for better comparison to LandPro2003 and is named &quot;LandPro01_adj.&quot; Likewise, LandPro99 was previously adjusted when LandPro2001 was completed, but was not further adjusted following the 2003 update. Although some adjustments were originally made to the 1995 land use/cover database for modeling applications, direct comparisons to previous versions of ARC land use/cover before 1999 should be avoided in most cases.The 2010 update has moved away from using the (1:14,000) scale, as will any future updates. Due to the use of local parcels, we have begun to snap LandPro boundaries to the parcel data, making a more accurate dataset. The major change in this update was to make residential areas reflect modern zoning codes more closely. Due to these changes you will no longer be able to compare this dataset to previous years. High density (113) has changed from lots below .25 to lots .25 and smaller. Medium density (112) has changed from .25 to 2 acre lots, to .26 to 1 acre lots. Low density has changed from 2 to 5 acre lots to 1.1 to 2 acre lots. It must be noted that in the 2010 update, you still have old acreage standards reflected in the low density. This will be corrected in the 2011 and 2012 updates. The main focus of the 2010 update was to make sure the LandPro' residential areas reflected the local parcels and change LandPro based on the parcel acreage. DeKalb is the only county not corrected at this time because no parcels were available. The future updates will consist of but are not limited to, reclassifying areas in 111 that do not meet the new acreage standards, delineating and reclassifying Cell Towers, substations and transmission lines/power cuts from TCU (14) to a subset of this (142), reclassifying airports as 141 form TCU, and reclassifying landfills form urban other (17) to 174. Other changes are delineating more roads other than just Limited Access Highways, making sure parks match the already existing Land use parks layer, and beginning to differentiate office from commercial and commercial/industrial.Classification System:111: Low Density Single Family Residential - Houses on 1.1 - 2 acre lots. Though 2010 still reflects the old standard of lots up to 5 acres.112: Medium Density Single Family Residential - These areas usually occur in urban or suburban zones and are generally characterized by houses on .26 to 1 acre lots. This category accounts for the majority of residential land use in the Region and includes a wide variety of neighborhood types.113: High Density Residential - Areas that have predominantly been developed for concentrated single family residential use. These areas occur almost exclusively in urban neighborhoods with streets on a grid network, and are characterized by houses on lots .25 acre or smaller but may also include mixed residential areas with duplexes and small apartment buildings.117: Multifamily Residential - Residential areas comprised predominantly of apartment, condominium and townhouse complexes where net density generally exceeds eight units per acre. Typical apartment buildings are relatively easy to identify, but some high rise structures may be interpreted as, or combined with, office buildings, though many of these dwellings were identified and delineated in downtown and midtown for the first time with the 2003 update. Likewise, some smaller apartments and townhouses may be interpreted as, or combined with, medium- or high-density single family residential. Housing on military bases, campuses, resorts, agricultural properties and construction work sites is not included in this or other residential categories.119: Mobile Home Parks - Areas that have been developed for single family mobile home use. These residential areas may occur in urban, suburban, or rural zones throughout the Region, with or without a significant mix of forested land cover. Due to their sparse distribution, individual mobile homes are generally mapped with the Forest land cover (Code 40) and Low- or Medium-Density Residential (Codes 111 and 112, respectively).12: Commercial and Services - Areas used predominantly for the sale of products and services, including urban central business districts, shopping centers in suburban and outlying areas, commercial strip developments, junk yards and resorts. The main buildings, secondary structures and areas supporting the basic use are all included: office buildings, warehouses, driveways, sheds, parking lots, landscaped areas, waste disposal areas, etc. Commercial areas may include some non-commercial uses too small to be separated out. Central business districts commonly include some institutions such as churches and schools, and commercial strip developments may include some residential units.121: Intensive Institutional - The built-up portions of institutional land holdings, including all buildings, grounds and parking lots that compose educational, religious, health, correctional and military facilities. Institutions occupying small areas (for example, many churches and some elementary and secondary schools) may be included in other categories, principally residential or commercial.122: Churches - subset of Commercial and Services.125: Extensive Institutional - Public or private land holdings devoted to educational, religious, health, correctional, or military land use. This category is one of only two that is used exclusively for land use classifications, the other being Park Lands (Code 175). As the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for Atlanta, ARC is required to produce long range population and employment forecasts which are used in transportation modeling. The land use categories of Extensive Institutional and Park Lands are important to ARC's long range forecasts since large tracts of land controlled by governments and institutions are more likely to be withheld from residential, commercial, or industrial development. Unlike Intensive Institutional (Code 121) which is visible on, and delineated from, the digital aerial photography, Extensive Institutional can only be identified and mapped from collateral data sources. The primary source of this information comes from the GIS Coordinators for each of the 21 counties and the City of Atlanta who reviewed the previous designations and provided updated information and additional GIS or CAD data. Various secondary sources include hard copy, digital and internet maps and files. Please note, the built-up land cover portion of these various tracts of land are generally identified as Intensive Institutional (Code 121). The Extensive Institutional land use areas identify the full extent of these tracts which are both built-up and non-built-up.13: Industrial - Land associated with light or heavy manufacturing. Light industries, those focused on design, assembly, finishing, processing and packaging of products, can be difficult to identify using aerial photography. Heavy industries, those focused on the use of raw materials, such as timber and steel, are relatively uncommon in the Atlanta Region, but the category may include lumber mills and tank farms, as well as chemical, cement and brick-making plants. For this mapping effort, industrial land cover is more commonly captured with the Industrial and Commercial Complexes category (Code 15) which is described below.14: Transportation, Communication and Utilities - Also referred to as &quot;TCU,&quot; this category encompasses various land use types associated with transportation, communication, and utilities. Much of the automotive transportation is accounted for in other categories, particularly highways and their right-of-ways, which are either absorbed into the context of a more dominant land cover (e.g. residential or commercial), or are covered completely within the Limited Access Highways category (Code 145) described below. Other types of transportation include service and terminal facilities, railways (including MARTA) and their stations, parking lots, roundhouses, repair and switching yards, as well as overland track and spur connections. Airport facilities may include runways, terminals, service buildings, navigation aids, fuel storage, parking lots, and intervening land. Similar to streets and highways, communication and utility networks generally fall below the minimum mapping standards, thus are not separated out of the context of the larger land use with which they are associated. When practical, areas involved in the processing, treatment and transportation of water, gas, oil, and electricity, such as pumping stations and electric substations have been delineated. Likewise, areas used for airwave communications, such as radio, radar, or television may be mapped in this category.142: Cell Towers, substations and transmission lines/power cuts, a subset of TCU (14).145: Limited Access Highways - This category identifies all highways, or portions of highways that are considered &quot;limited access,&quot; their approximate right-of-ways, ramps and interchanges. In addition to the 8 interstate highways in the Region (I-20, I-75, I-85, I-285, I-575, I-595, I-675, and I-985), this category includes the entire extents of the Stone Mountain Freeway, Ronald Reagan Parkway, Freedom Parkway, Arthur Langford Parkway, the Canton Road Connector, and Spur 14 connecting the South Fulton Parkway to I-285. Likewise, portions of the Camp Creek Parkway, Appalachian Highway, Peachtree Industrial Boulevard, and Georgia Highway 316 are also included. Finally, cartographic license was taken with Georgia Highway 400 to extend this designation northward through Forsyth County, slightly beyond where interchanges stop and intersections begin, thus ceasing to actually be limited access highway.15: Industrial and Commercial Complexes - Industrial and commercial areas that typically occur together or in close functional proximity with one another. For this mapping effort, based primarily on the interpretation of aerial photography, industrial areas are more commonly grouped in this category than in the Industrial (Code 13) category. In as much as various functions, such as warehousing, wholesaling and occasionally retailing may be found in the same structures or adjacent structures, this more inclusive category has been used to combine commercial with industrial. Industrial parks are almost always classified in this category.17: Other Urban - Open land in intensive or indeterminate urban uses that do not require or do not have structures. Examples include water control structures and spillways, waste dumps, landfills, golf driving ranges and other recreation areas not identified as parks. This category excludes golf courses, cemeteries and active parks, which are contained in separate categories. 171: Golf Courses - The &quot;green space&quot; areas of golf courses, including tees, fairways, greens and intervening land. Forest areas and ponds are often included, but may also be identified separately (Code 40 and 53, respectively) depending on their size. Likewise, other built-up facilities, such as parking lots, clubhouses, pools, courts, etc. may be classified as commercial/services (Code 12).172: Cemeteries - Public and private lands devoted to burial grounds, including primary and secondary buildings and associated infrastructure. Because of their unique photo &quot;signature,&quot; many small cemeteries can be identified from the digital imagery at a scale of 1:14,000; many others, however, may be combined with residential, commercial, forest, or agriculture land cover. Forest areas and ponds are often included in this category, but may also be identified separately (Code 40 and 53, respectively) depending on their size.173: Parks - Active recreation areas identified from aerial photography, including baseball and other sports fields, tennis courts, swimming pools, camp grounds, parking lots, structures, drives, and trails. Forest areas and ponds are often included, but may also be identified separately (Code 40 and 53, respectively) depending on their size.175: Park Lands - Local, state, or federal land holdings devoted to preservation, conservation or recreation, as identified from secondary sources. This category is one of only two that is used exclusively for land use classifications, the other being Extensive Institutional (Code 125). As the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for Atlanta, ARC is required to produce long range population and employment forecasts which are used in transportation modeling. The land use categories of Park Lands and Extensive Institutional are important to ARC's long range forecasts since large tracts of land controlled by governments and institutions are more likely to be withheld from residential, commercial, or industrial development. Unlike Parks (Code 173) which are visible on, and delineated from, the digital aerial photography, Park Lands can only be identified and mapped from collateral data sources. The primary source of this information comes from the GIS Coordinators for each of the 21 counties and the City of Atlanta who reviewed the previous designations and provided updated information and additional GIS or CAD data. Various secondary sources include hardcopy, digital and internet maps and files. Please note, the built-up land cover portion of these various tracts of land are generally identified as Parks (Code 173). The Park Land land use areas identify the full extent of these tracts which are both built-up.20: Agriculture - All areas of cropland, pasture, orchards, vineyards, nurseries, and confined feeding operations. Cropland and Pasture are regularly used to grow field crops or to pasture animals. Orchards, Vineyards and Nurseries are land used to produce fruit, nuts or living plants for sale or for propagation. Confined Feeding Operations are land used for specialized livestock production enterprises where large animal populations are restricted to small areas. Such land uses include cattle feed lots, dairy operations with little or no pasture, large poultry farms and hog feed lots. Shipping corrals and other temporary holding facilities are generally excluded, as are horse farms and equestrian facilities which have lower animal population densities. Agriculture-Other is land used for livestock holding, breeding and training areas, including farmsteads and associated infrastructure, such as small farm lanes, roads, ditches, canals and ponds.40: Forest - All forested areas of coniferous and/or deciduous trees.51: Rivers - The Chattahoochee River extending from Buford Dam in Gwinnett and Forsyth counties south to Heard County and the Etowah River extending from the Bartow, Floyd County boundary to the Allatoona Dam. Other &quot;linear&quot; water bodies, such as smaller rivers, streams, creeks, and canals fall below the mapping standards used for inclusion in this category.53: Reservoirs, Lakes, and Ponds - Man-made impoundments, often referred to as &quot;lakes&quot; or &quot;ponds,&quot; which are persistently covered with water. Please note, as there are no known naturally occurring lakes in the Region, the previous class called Lakes (Code 52) has been dropped from the classification system. For larger reservoirs, the water control structures themselves are often classified in Other Urban (Code 17).60: Wetlands - Forested and/or herbaceous areas where the water table is at, near or above the land surface for a significant part of the growing season in most years. Wetland polygons were delineated at a scale of 1:6,000 using the CIR imagery after all other land cover delineations had been made at 1:14,000, mostly with the true color imagery. The NWI data was used as the primary &quot;back coverage&quot; in ARC/Info for reference to wetland boundary and classification information. This information was concurrently compared to USGS digital raster graph (DRGs) topographic images which were viewed at the same scale in ArcView for reference to contours, hydrography, and other topographic information. ARC's land cover delineations represent the synthesis of these two older data sources against the 1999 CIR digital imagery using the minimum mapping standards established for the project.74: Bare Exposed Rock - Naturally occurring areas of exposed bedrock with little or no vegetative cover.75: Quarries, Gravel Pits, and Strip Mines - Land which is currently, or was in the past, used to extract rocks and minerals, and has had its vegetation cover removed and not replaced. Pits which have been flooded with water are often included in this category, but may also be identified separately as artificial impoundments (Code 53) depending on their size.76: Transitional Areas - Recently cleared or altered land in transition from one land use activity, either built-up or non-built-up, to another unknown or non-determinate land use.Source: Atlanta Regional CommissionDate: 2012\",\n",

The data covers all plants with a combined nameplate capacity of 1 MW (Megawatt) or more.In 2016, most U.S. electricity was generated using fossil fuels. The largest energy source in the U.S. generating 4 trillion kilowatt hours of electricity was natural gas. Natural gas was the source of about 34% of electric generation. The second largest energy source for electricity generation was coal with 30% of all power generation. Petroleum can be burned to produce electric generation, but this source is not a large source in power generation with less than 1% of U.S. electric generation. Nuclear power provided the U.S. with 1/5th of total U.S. electricity or about 20% of all U.S. electricity generation. Renewable energy sources provided 15% of total U.S. electricity in 2016. Hydropower generated 7% of total U.S. electricity generation and about 44% of electricity generation from renewable energy. Electricity generation from wind has increased significantly in the United States since 1970. In 2016, wind power provided almost 6% of U.S. electricity generation and about 37% of electricity generation from renewable energy.Biomass is a material derived from plants or animals and includes lumber, paper mill wastes, food scraps, grass, leaves and paper. Biomass can also include forestry and agricultural residues such as wood chips, corn cobs and wheat straw. However, Biomass has only accounted for 2% of the total U.S. electricity generation in 2016. Solar power produces energy from the sun and in 2016, generated about 1% of U.S. electricity generation. Geothermal power comes from heat energy beneath the surface of the earth. However, here again geothermal power generation was less than 1% of total U.S. electricity generation in 2016.Power PlantsData currency: June 26, 2017Data source:\\xa0MAPSFor more information, please visit:\\xa0Electricity - ExplainedFor feedback:\\xa0ArcGIScomNationalMaps@esri.comThumbnail source image courtesy of:\\xa0Jeanne MenjouletSymbology courtesy of the following\\xa0Noun Project\\xa0contributors:\\xa0Lisa Staudinger, Robert Beerwerth, Nikita Kozin, emilegraphics, Ron Scott, BomSymbols, Andrejs Kirma, Becris, Symbolon and IconathonOther Federal User Community federally focused content that may interest you\\xa0U.S. Department of Energy\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Energy Information Administration\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: USDOE\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: EIA\\xa0',\n",

Just click on any selected box(es) in the map’s legend at right, then “Refresh.” Map layers listed closer to the top of the legend display over those listed below them. Zoom in by clicking the '+' magnifying-glass icon (second from top at left) and drawing a square around a selected portion of the map.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo read attributes of any points in the second series of layers, click on the appropriate boxes in the legend at right, to make the points &quot;Visible&quot; and &quot;Active,&quot; then on the Information icon &quot; i&quot; in the black circle at left of the map, and move the cross-hair cursor to click precisely on the selected point on the map. For phum, this displays the name of the village on that site.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor US bombing points, attributes of a site’s bombardment are displayed in tabular form, e.g. the date of the bombing, exact location, the number and type of aircraft in the sortie, bombing load and ordnance type, the nature of the intended target, and bomb damage assessment (BDA). Individual sortie payloads ranged in size from tens of lbs. to several thousand tons. The dataset details the 42 aircraft types deployed, including B-52's, and the 188 types of munitions they dropped, including 500-lb. 'carpet bombs', cluster bombs, fire bombs and 1000-lb. bombs.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the DK mass grave sites, attributes include the estimated number of pits and bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nSources and Acknowledgements\\r\\nCGEO’s 2005 version was prepared by Yale’s Cambodian Genocide Program in collaboration with Mr. Abraham Parrish of the Map Collection at Yale’s Sterling Memorial Library.

       "  'dc_description_s': \"The 2013 Area Deprivation Index (ADI) is based on a measure created by the\\xa0Health Resources &amp; Services Administration\\xa0(HRSA) over two decades ago for primarily county-level use, but refined, adapted, and validated to the Census block group/neighborhood\\xa0level by\\xa0Amy Kind, MD, PhD\\xa0and her research team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It allows for rankings of neighborhoods by socioeconomic status disadvantage in a region of interest (e.g. at the state or national level). It includes factors for the theoretical domains of income, education, employment, and housing quality. It can be used to inform health delivery and policy, especially for the most disadvantaged neighborhood groups.The state deciles are constructed by ranking the ADI from low to high for without consideration of national ADIs. Group 1 is the lowest ADI (least disadvantaged) and 10 is the highest ADI (most disadvantaged).ADI CompositionFrom the journal article: (2003). Area deprivation and widening inequalities in US mortality, 1969-1998.\\xa0American journal of public health,\\xa093(7), 1137-43.In constructing an index, Singh considered &quot;21 socioeconomic indicators that may be viewed as approximating the material and social conditions and relative socioeconomic disadvantage in a given community. Indicators were selected on the basis of their theoretical relevance and on the basis of previous empirical research.\\xa0These indicators, drawn from the 1990 census, included educational distribution (percentage of the population with less than 9 years and with 12 or more years of education), median family income, income disparity, occupational composition, unemployment rate, family poverty rate, percentage of the population below 150% of the poverty rate, single-parent household rate, home ownership rate, median home value, median gross rent, median monthly mortgage, and household crowding. Other indicators were percentages of households without access to a telephone, plumbing, or motor vehicles; English language proficiency; divorce rate; percentage of urban population; and percentage of immigrant population.&quot;Considerations for UseThe ADI is limited insofar as it uses 2013 American Community Survey Five Year Estimates in its construction. All limitations of the source data will persist throughout the ADI. The choice of geographic units will also influence the ADI value. In the case of the 2013 ADI the Census block group is the geographic unit of construction and all results are subject to the accuracy and errors contained within the 2013 American Community Survey data release.The original layer is the 2017 Wisconsin Census Block Group Boundaries and the ADI values have been appended to the layer as two attribute fields, the national ADI rankings and the state ADI rankings. The state rankings are the ones used for WSGN mapping applications.\\xa0About the\\xa02017 Wisconsin Census Block Group Boundaries layer:The 2017 cartographic boundary shapefiles are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). These boundary files are specifically designed for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.\\n\\nBlock Groups (BGs) are clusters of blocks within the same census tract. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tracts. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, tabulation blocks numbered 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within census tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. BGs coded 0 are intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. Block groups generally contain between 600 and 3,000 people. A BG usually covers a contiguous area but never crosses county or census tract boundaries. They may, however, cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas.\\n\\nThe generalized BG boundaries in this release are based on those that were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2010 Census.\",\n",

Ancillary data sources included GIS data provided by Lake County or created by the UVM Spatial Analysis Laboratory. This buildingsdataset is considered current as of Summer, 2013. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract building information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. Following the automated OBIA mapping a detailed manual review of the dataset was carried out at a scale of 1:2,500 and all observable errors were corrected.This dataset contains footprints for buildings and some large out buildings.

This group anticipated finding accurate information on wind energy facilities and turbines in the public sphere, like the type of data available for oil and gas wells. However, turbine information was lacking, and it became apparent that scientists, regulatory agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and other decision-makers all needed spatially accurate wind turbine information. Each of the 1,537 turbine locations includes corresponding facility information and turbine technical specifications.\\xa0Electric substations are facilities and equipment that switch, transform or regulate electric voltage. The electric substation feature class in this service includes taps, which are locations where power on a transmission line is tapped by another transmission line. Electric substations are part of the electric network system helping to move electricity\\xa0to where it is needed.Electric power transmission lines are the system of structures, wires, insulators and associated hardware that carry electric power from one point to another in an electric power network. Lines are operated at high voltages varying from 69 kV (Kilo Volts) up to 765 kV and can transmit large quantities of electricity over long distances.

The HCWI does not classify wetlands but merely locates them, whereas the NWI classifies wetlands based on the Cowardin methodology utilizing remotely gathered data and photo signature. For more information concerning detail on procedures followed to develop the HCWI contact Hennepin County Dept. of Environmental Services.National Wetland Inventory Metadata:The National Wetland Inventory (NWI) for east-central Minnesota were updated through multi-agency collaborative effort under leadership from the Minnesota DNR. Operational support for wetland mapping and classification was provided by Ducks Unlimited and support for methods development and field validation were provided by the Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis Laboratory at the University of Minnesota. Major funding was provided by the Environmental and Natural Resources Trust Fund.The project area consists of 13 counties in east-central Minnesota including: Anoka, Carver, Chisago, Dakota, Goodhue, Hennepin, Isanti, Ramsey, Rice, Scott, Sherburne, Washington, and Wright Counties. The updated wetland inventory area included complete coverage for all USGS quarter quadrangles that intersect any of these counties (about 7,150 square miles).\\xa0The NWI classification process for east-central Minnesota consisted of three basic steps: 1) creation of image segments (polygons), 2) RandomForest classification of the segments, and 3) photo-interpretation of the classified image segments. The updated NWI also contains a Simplified Plant Community Classification and a Simplified Hydrogemorphic Classification. Quality assurance of the data included a 100% visual inspection, automated checks for attribute validity and topologic consistency, as well as a formal accuracy assessment based on an independent field verified data set. Further details on the methods employed can be found in the technical procedures document for this project (provide URL).\\xa0The updated NWI data are primarily based on aerial imagery acquired in 2010 and 2011 as well as other modern ancillary data. This data is intended to replace the original NWI data which was based on imagery acquired in the early 1980s. NWI data support effective wetland management, protection, and restoration. The data provide a baseline for assessing the effectiveness of wetland policies and management actions. These data are used at all levels of government, as well as by private industry and non-profit organizations for wetland regulation and management, land use and conservation planning, environmental impact assessment, and natural resource inventories.\\xa0Link to Attribute Table Information:\\xa0http://gis.hennepin.us/OpenData/Metadata/Wetland%20Inventory.pdf\\xa0Data updated: Fall 2014Use Limitations: This data (i) is furnished &quot;AS IS&quot; with no representation as to completeness or accuracy; (ii) is furnished with no warranty of any kind; and (iii) is not suitable for legal, engineering or surveying purposes.

       "  'dc_description_s': 'The CalFish Abundance Database contains a comprehensive collection of anadromous fisheries abundance information. Beginning in 1998, the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, began a cooperative project aimed at collecting, archiving, and entering into standardized electronic formats, the wealth of information generated by fisheries resource management agencies and tribes throughout California.Extensive data are currently available for chinook, coho, and steelhead. Major data categories include adult abundance population estimates, actual fish and/or carcass counts, counts of fish collected at dams, weirs, or traps, and redd counts. Harvest data has also been compiled for many streams.This CalFish Abundance Database shapefile was generated from fully routed 1:100,000 hydrography. In a few cases streams had to be added to the hydrography dataset in order to provide a means to create shapefiles to represent abundance data associated with them. Streams added were digitized at no more than 1:24,000 scale based on stream line images portrayed in 1:24,000 Digital Raster Graphics (DRG).These features represent abundance information resulting from counts at weirs, fish ladders, or other point-type monitoring protocols such as beach seining. The point features in this layer typically represent the location for which abundance data records apply. In many cases there are multiple datasets associated with the same point location, and so, point features overlap. Please view the associated datasets for detail regarding specific features. In CalFish these are accessed through the \"link\" field that is visible when performing an identify or query operation. A URL string is provided with each feature in the downloadable data which can also be used to access the underlying datasets.The steelhead data that is available via the CalFish website is actually linked directly to the StreamNet website where the database\\'\\'s tabular data is currently stored. Additional information about StreamNet may be downloaded at http://www.streamnet.org. Complete documentation for the StreamNet database may be accessed at http://www.streamnet.org/def.html',\n",

However, as of 2012, the U.S. is the world's largest gas producer, recently\\xa0surpassing Russia. U.S. gas producers are pressing the U.S. government to give the green light for exporting LNG to Asia and Europe, to access growing markets for natural gas at higher prices. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is responsible for authorizing siting and construction of LNG export terminals that are onshore or that are close to the shore. Currently, FERC has approved four export LNG terminals for construction. These include:Dominion Energy's Cove Point LNG facility in Cove Point, Maryland, is scheduled to bring one train totaling 0.82 Billion Cubic Feet Per Day (Bcf/d) online near the end of 2017.Corpus Christi LNG, a Cheniere project, is under construction in Corpus Christi, Texas. The terminal is scheduled to begin service in 2018, with total permitted capacity at 2.14 Billion Cubic Feet Per Day (Bcf/d).Sempra Energy's Cameron LNG terminal, located in Hackberry, Louisiana, is under construction and is scheduled to bring three trains online in 2018. A total of 1.7 Billion Cubic Feet Per Day (Bcf/d) has been permitted.Freeport LNG's terminal planned for Freeport, Texas, has three trains under construction totaling 1.8 Billion Cubic Feet Per Day (Bcf/d). The first two are scheduled to begin service in 2019, and the third in 2020.Several more export terminals, mostly on the Gulf Coast, have been proposed or have pending applications with FERC.LNG Import Export Terminals by Storage CapacityData currency: 2016Data source:\\xa0MAPSFor more information, please visit:\\xa0Today In EnergyFor feedback:\\xa0ArcGIScomNationalMaps@esri.comThumbnail source image courtesy of:\\xa0Roy LuckOther Federal User Community federally focused content that may interest you\\xa0U.S. Department of Energy\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Energy Information Administration\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: USDOE\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: EIA\",\n",

This layer was originally built in the late 1990's by digitizing Assessor map images and rubbersheeting to control sources like GPS road centerline, USGS Quadrangle maps, orthoimagery, and County Flood Control topo maps. Overtime, the spatial accuracy of this layer has improved significantly using COGO and geodetic control when available on recorded subdivision maps. Various methods are used to update this layer including direct COGO using traverse, tracing boundaries from images, and CAD to GIS transformation. Countywide orthoimagery is also used for survey control during tax parcel updates. In some cases spatial adjustments (eg. rubbersheeting) or best-fit decisions are made to complete updates in a timely manner. As the number of subdivision maps record with geodetic control increases, the greater the positional accuracy of this layer will increase. The layer was last cleaned for topology errors July of 2015. All errors of overlaps and gaps between polygons were corrected at that time. Topologogy checks are ran on an annual basis, if needed, around areas where tax parcel boundary changes have occurred. At any one time throughout the year, in the vicinity of newly created or modified parcels, there may be slight errors in the topological integrity. Athough every effort is made to maintain the highest level of accuracy during all phases of layer modifications. Parcel polygon attributes have been updated to include property characteristics as well. 8/23/2018: updated to reflect the 2018 closed tax assessment roll: 1) Assessor tax parcel maps affected by recordings on or before 12/31/2017. 2) Primary assessee or owner as of lien date, 1/1/2018. \",\n",

FIRMS integrates remote sensing and GIS technologies to deliver global MODIS hotspot/fire locations to natural resource managers and other stakeholders around the World.\\xa0MODIS stands for MODerate \\xa0Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. The MODIS instrument is on board NASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites. The orbit of the Terra satellite goes from north to south across the equator in the morning and Aqua passes south to north over the equator in the afternoon resulting in global coverage every 1 to 2 days. The EOS satellites have a ±55 degree scanning pattern and orbit at 705 km with a 2,330 km swath width.\\xa0It takes approximately 2 – 4 hours after satellite overpass for MODIS Rapid Response to process the data, and for FIRMS to update the website. Occasionally, hardware errors mean that it takes longer the 2-4 hours to process the data. For information on the system status of MODIS Rapid Response,\\xa0click here.\\xa0We gather this data from the\\xa0EOSDIS download site. These shapefiles from NASA are parsed using the\\xa0Aggregated Live Feeds methodology\\xa0to take the returned information and serve the data through ArcGIS Server as a map service.\\xa0For performance reasons these layers do not draw when zoomed out beyond 1:20000000.\\xa0Attribute Information:Latitude and Longitude: The center point location of the 1km (approx.) pixel flagged as containing one or more fires/hotspots (fire size is not 1km, but variable). See\\xa0What does a hotspot/fire detection mean on the ground?Brightness: The brightness temperature, measured (in Kelvin) using the MODIS channels 21/22 and channel 31.Scan and Track: The actual spatial resolution of the scanned pixel. Although the algorithm works at 1km resolution, the MODIS pixels get bigger toward the edge of the scan. See\\xa0What does scan and track mean?Date: Acquisition date of the hotspot/active fire pixel.Time: Time of the overpass of the satellite (in UTC).Satellite: Whether the detection was picked up by the Terra or Aqua satellite.Confidence: The detection confidence is a quality flag of the individual hotspot/active fire pixel.Version: Version refers to the processing collection and source of data. The number before the decimal refers to the\\xa0collection(e.g. MODIS\\xa0Collection 5). The number after the decimal indicates the source of Level 1B data; data processed in near-real time byMODIS Rapid Response\\xa0will have the source code “CollectionNumber.0”. Data sourced from\\xa0MODAPS\\xa0(with a 2 month lag) and processed by FIRMS using the standard MOD14/MYD14 Thermal Anomalies algorithm will have a source code “CollectionNumber.x”. For example, data with the version listed as 5.0 is collection 5, processed by MRR, data with the version listed as 5.1 is collection 5 data processed by FIRMS using Level 1B data from MODAPS. See\\xa0What is the difference between data sourced from MODIS Rapid Response and MODAPS Collection 5?Bright.T31: Channel 31 brightness temperature (in Kelvins) of the hotspot/active fire pixel.FRP: Fire Radiative Power. Depicts the pixel-integrated fire radiative power in MW (MegaWatts). FRP provides information on the measured radiant heat output of detected fires. The amount of radiant heat energy liberated per unit time (the Fire Radiative Power) is thought to be related to the rate at which fuel is being consumed (Wooster et. al. (2005))\",\n",

Geographic aggregations\\nof the 50 States and the District of Columbia into five districts by the\\nPetroleum Administration for Defense in 1950. These districts were originally\\ndefined during World War II for purposes of administering oil allocation. \\nSee http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/monthly/pdf/append.pdf.\\n\\nAtmospheric Distillation Mbpd (AD_Mbpd):\\nUsually a good proxy for general facility capacity.  \\nThe volume of crude oil, measured in thousands of barrels per day (Mb/d),\\nprocessed by the atmospheric distillation chamber of a refinery.\\nThe refining process of\\nseparating crude oil components at atmospheric pressure by heating to\\ntemperatures of about 600Âº to 750Âº F (depending on the nature of the crude oil\\nand desired products) and subsequent condensing of the fractions by cooling. \\n\\nVacuum Distillation Mbpd (VDist_Mbpd):\\nThe volume of crude oil, measured in thousands of barrels per day (Mb/d),\\nprocessed by the vacuum distillation chamber of a refinery.\\nDistillation under reduced pressure (less the atmospheric) which lowers the\\nboiling temperature of the liquid being distilled. This technique with its\\nrelatively low temperatures prevents cracking or decomposition of the charge\\nstock. \\n\\nCatalytic Cracking Mbpd (CaDis_Mbpd):\\nThe volume of crude oil, measured in thousands of barrels per day (Mb/d),\\nprocessed by the catalytic disintegration chamber of a refinery.\\nThe refining process of breaking down the larger, heavier, and more complex\\nhydrocarbon molecules into simpler and lighter molecules.  Catalytic cracking\\nis accomplished by the use of a catalytic agent and is an effective process for\\nincreasing the yield of gasoline from crude oil.  Catalytic cracking processes\\nfresh feeds and recycled feeds. \\n\\nHydrocracking Mbpd (HyCrk_Mbpd):\\nCatalytic hydrocracking downstream charge capacity, thousand barrels per stream day. \\nA refining process that uses hydrogen and catalysts with\\nrelatively low temperatures and high pressures for converting middle boiling or\\nresidual material to high-octane gasoline, reformer charge stock, jet fuel,\\nand/or high grade fuel oil. The process uses one or more catalysts, depending\\nupon product output, and can handle high sulfur feedstocks without prior\\ndesulfurization. \\n\\nViscosity Reduction Mbpd (VRedu_Mbpd):\\nThe volume of crude oil, measured in thousands of barrels per day (Mb/d),\\nprocessed by the viscosity reduction chamber of a refinery. A\\nthermal cracking process in which heavy atmospheric or vacuum-still bottoms are\\ncracked at moderate temperatures to increase production of distillate products\\nand reduce viscosity of the distillation residues. \\n\\nCatalytic Reformation Mbpd (CaRef_Mbpd):\\nThe volume of crude oil, measured in thousands of barrels per day (Mb/d),\\nprocessed by the catalytic reformation chamber of a refinery.\\nA refining process using controlled heat and pressure with catalysts to\\nrearrange certain hydrocarbon molecules, thereby converting paraffinic and\\nnaphthenic type hydrocarbons (e.g., low-octane gasoline boiling range\\nfractions) into petrochemical feedstocks and higher octane stocks suitable for\\nblending into finished gasoline. \\n\\nIsomerization Mbpd (Isal_Mbpd):\\nThe volume of crude oil, measured in thousands of barrels per day (Mb/d),\\nprocessed by the alkylation and isomerization chambers of a refinery.\\n\\nHydrodesulphurization Mbpd:\\nThe volume of crude oil, measured in thousands of barrels per day (Mb/d),\\nprocessed by the hydrodesulphurization chamber of a refinery. The removal of\\nsulfur, as from molten metals, petroleum oil, or flue gases.  Petroleum\\ndesulfurization is a process that removes sulfur and its compounds from various\\nstreams during the refining process. Desulfurization processes include\\ncatalytic hydrotreating and other chemical/physical processes such as\\nabsorption. Desulfurization processes vary based on the type of stream treated\\n(e.g. naphtha, distillate, heavy gas oil, etc.) and the amount of sulfur\\nremoved (e.g. sulfur reduction to 10 ppm). \\n\\nCoking Mbpd (Cokin_Mbpd):\\nThe volume of crude oil, measured in thousands of barrels per day (Mb/d),\\nprocessed by the coking chamber of a refinery. A thermal cracking\\nprocess utilizing the fluidized-solids technique to remove carbon (coke) for\\ncontinuous conversion of heavy, low-grade oils into lighter products.\\n\\nAsphalt Mbpd (Asph_Mbpd):\\nThe maximum amount of asphalt products, measured in thousands of barrels per\\nday (Mb/d), that can be produced at the refinery.\\n\\nSource\\nOriginal Data Source\\n\\nPeriod:\\nOriginal Data Date\\n\\nLatitude:\\nWGS 84 latitude\\n\\nLongitude\\nWGS 84 longitude\\n',\n",

It represents a seamless, spatial database of 48 State geologic maps that range from town sized scale (1:50,000) to county sized scale (1:1,000,000). A national digital geologic map database is essential in interpreting other datasets that support numerous types of national-scale studies and assessments, such as those that provide geochemistry, remote sensing, or geophysical data.\\xa0The SGMC is a compilation of the individual USGS releases of the Preliminary Integrated Geologic Map Databases for the U.S. It also contains updated data for seven states and seven entirely new state geologic maps that have been added since the preliminary databases were published. Numerous errors have been corrected and enhancements added to the preliminary datasets using thorough quality assurance/quality control procedures. The SGMC is not a truly integrated geologic map database because geologic units have not been reconciled across state boundaries. However, the geologic data contained in each state geologic map have been standardized to allow spatial analyses of lithology, age, and stratigraphy at a national scale.\\xa0A full discussion of the procedures and methodology used to create this dataset is available in the accompanying report: Horton, J.D., San Juan, C.A., and Stoeser, D.B, 2017,\\xa0The State Geologic Map Compilation (SGMC) geodatabase of the conterminous United States\\xa0(ver. 1.1, August 2017): U.S. Geological Survey Data Series 1052, 46 p.SGMC PointsData currency: Current USGSFor more information:\\xa0The State Geologic Map Compilation (SGMC) Geodatabase of the Conterminous United StatesFor feedback please contact:\\xa0ArcGIScomNationalMaps@esri.comThumbnail source image courtesy of:\\xa0John FowlerOther Federal User Community content and data that may interest youDepartment of the Interior\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0U.S Geological Survey\\xa0Open Data:\\xa0USDOI\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Open Data: USGS',\n",

Notes: The Shore Unit Classifications Polygons depict the most current areas of Shorezone mapping for the Province of British Columbia. Shorezone is an aerial imaging, habitat classification, and mapping system used to inventory alongshore and across-shore geomorphological and biological attributes of the coast. Habitat attributes are interpreted from oblique aerial imagery acquired during the lowest tides of the year. The mapping project was first developed as an oil spill response tool for British Columbia, and now ShoreZone extends from Oregon to Alaska and has many other uses including ecological studies, marine conservation planning, coastal flooding and vulnerability assessments, and community education.Suggested Filters:Habitat - Sediment Source - Colour Fill: SEDIMENT_SOURCE_NAME is not NULLHabitat - Sediment Abundance - Colour Fill: SEDIMENT_ABUNDANCE_NAME is not NULLHabitat - Tide Type - Colour Fill: TIDE_TYPE_DEF is not  NULLHabitat - Zone - Colour Fill: ZONE is not NULLShoreunits - Shoreunit Change Type - Colour Filled: CHANGE_TYPE_CODE IS NOT NULLShoreunits - Oil Residency Index - Colour Themed: OIL_RESIDENCY_DEFINITION IS NOT NULLSee how to apply filters.WMS GetCapabilities URL:DataBC also offers access to this data in OGC WMS format.

Floterial districts overlay other NH House of Representatives districts (&quot;base&quot; districts), which are available from companion shape file NHHouseDists2012. Both shape files are required to depict all NH House of Representatives districts. District boundaries were derived by applying district codes retrieved from the NH Secretary of State web site to the geometry provided by the GRANIT town boundary layer (PBNH).Definition of Floterial District from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floterial_district) \\xa0A\\xa0floterial district\\xa0is a legislative district that includes several separate districts that independently would not be entitled to additional representation, but whose combined population entitles the area to another seat in the legislative body. It is a technique that a state may be authorized to use to achieve more equal\\xa0apportionment\\xa0by population during\\xa0redistricting.In common usage, a floterial district is not just a multi-town district, but a multi-town district that &quot;floats&quot; over towns that already elect one or more legislators. For example, a city due more than five representatives but not quite six might elect five representing the city itself, and one more in a floterial district that includes some neighboring towns whose small populations, alone, would not merit even a single representative.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDigital data in NH GRANIT represent the efforts of the\\r\\ncontributing agencies to record information from the cited source materials.\\r\\nComplex Systems Research Center, under contract to the NH Office of Energy and\\r\\nPlanning, and in consultation with cooperating agencies, maintains a continuing\\r\\nprogram to identify and correct errors in these data.

The members of group 2 used ERDAS Imagine to conduct an unsupervised image classification to identify areas of Mountain Top Removal (MTR) in our project area. We created 50 different classes, and identified each class as MTR or non-MTR areas (and re-colored and labeled each area accordingly). After all classes had beed identified and edited, we reclassified the raster and converted the data to a polygon shapefile. Next, we calculated our data's accuracy by using the create random points tool to create 30 random points within our project area. We then went through and noted whether each spot was correctly identified (the point was in a labeled MTR area and the aerial imagery actually showed MTR activity, or if the point was not in an MTR area in our data and the aerial imagery). The final step for each group member was to create a layer package to be sent to the group leader with our MTR layer complete with accuracy, total MTR acres in the area, and change from the 2005 data to the 2010 data.\\n     I was the group leader, so I reviewed each data set to make sure that they each met the required parameters to be considered MTR areas as set by Skytruth. I also checked the accuracy of each group and decided which datasets to use and which to exclude. After reviewing the listed accuracy for each layer and comparing the MTR area polygons to the aerial imagery, I decided to include all layers because each added some necessary points to the map. Many of the main MTR areas visible in the aerial imagery were contained by one or more of the MTR polygons. We did miss a few MTR areas, but overall I feel that we did well considering our limited knowledge of aerial photography interpretation. It was also my first time completing analysis with Erdas Imagine. Overall, I feel that we overcame some large challenges to create a polished final project.\",\n",

In December 2010, the Tigard City Council adopted the 2035 Transportation System Plan (TSP) that links    expected growth with transportation needs. This update is timely for two reasons. First, traffic congestion    has consistently ranked as the number one issue facing Tigard in community attitude surveys and the    City is committed to finding solutions to this issue. Secondly, the community has developed a vision    for Tigard's future and a key component of this vision is developing an efficient and balanced multi-modal    transportation system.      The 2035 TSP sets the policy framework for the city's transportation system. It includes a list of strategies    and projects that will guide future investments. The strategies range from access management, to connectivity    improvements, to &quot;smarter&quot; traffic signals. There are more than 140 identified transportation projects    ranging from sidewalk infill to freeway over-passes. Identification of these transportation projects is    important because in order to qualify for federal transportation funds they must be identified in the TSP.   Transportation funds are limited and highly competitive for large expensive projects. For this reason,    a major theme of this TSP update is the need to make the most out of the existing transportation system.    We believe this can be accomplished through effective management and strategic investments such as    improved street connections, new trails, sidewalks, bicycle facilities, intersection improvements,    and transit service. All of these improvements are aimed at providing safe and efficient transportation    options for the community.For general information visit the City's home page.

Although it has a landuse component which is used for forecasts and modeling at ARC, outside users should be aware that the landcover and landuse delineations are based on photo-interpretation of a 5-acre and 25-acre minimum mapping unit respectively, not parcels. Likewise, LandPro2007 should not be taken out of its Regional context, though county-level or municipal-level analysis may be useful for transportation, environmental and landuse planning. LandPro2007 is ARC's landuse/landcover GIS database for the 20-county Atlanta Region (Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry, Rockdale, the EPA non-attainment (1hr standard) counties of Forsyth, Paulding and Coweta. and the EPA non-attainment (8hr standard) counties of Carroll, Barrow, Bartow, Hall, Newton, Spalding and Walton). LandPro2005 was created by on-screen photo-interpretation and digitizing of ortho-rectified aerial photography at a scale of 1:14,000. The primary source for this GIS database was 2007 true color imagery with 1.64-foot pixel resolution, provided by Aerials Express, Inc.Though the terms are often used interchangeably, landuse and\\r\\nlandcover are not synonymous.\\xa0 Landcover\\r\\ngenerally refers to the natural or cultivated vegetation, rock, or water\\r\\ncovering the land, as well as the developed surface which can be identified on\\r\\naerial photography.\\xa0 Landuse generally\\r\\nrefers to the way that humans use or will use the land, regardless of its\\r\\napparent landcover.\\xa0 Collateral data for\\r\\nthe landcover mapping effort included the Aero Surveys of Georgia street atlas,\\r\\nthe Georgia Department of Community Affairs (DCA) Community Facilities database\\r\\nand the USGS Digital Raster Graphics (DRGs) of 1:24,000 scale topographic\\r\\nmaps.\\xa0 The landuse component of this database\\r\\nwas added after the landcover interpretation was completed, and is based\\r\\nprimarily on ownership information provided by the 20 counties and the City of\\r\\nAtlanta for larger tracts of undeveloped land that meet the landuse definition\\r\\nof &quot;Extensive Institutional&quot; or &quot;Park Lands&quot; (refer to the\\r\\nCode Descriptions and Discussion section below).\\xa0 Although some of the boundaries of these\\r\\ntracts may align with visible features from the aerial photography, these areas\\r\\nare generally &quot;non-photo-identifiable,&quot; thus require other sources\\r\\nfor accurate identification.\\xa0 The minimum\\r\\nmapping unit standard for this database is generally 5 acres, with varying\\r\\nexceptions based on category and context.\\xa0\\r\\nSome smaller Intensive Institutional (mostly elementary schools),\\r\\nCommercial, Cemeteries, and Reservoirs (impoundments) have been intentionally\\r\\ndelineated in some cases throughout the Region.\\xa0\\r\\nWithin the downtown and midtown areas, many small polygons of\\r\\nmulti-family residential have been identified and added with the 2003 update\\r\\nand expanded upon in the 2005 and in the 2007 update through research of mostly\\r\\nweb-based resources.\\xa0 Within\\r\\nsingle-family neighborhoods, differentiation of adjacent residential areas\\r\\n(111-low density, 112-medium density, and 113-high density) is generally 25\\r\\nacres, and within agricultural areas, delineation of some forested areas (Code\\r\\n40) is occasionally larger.\\xa0 25 acres is\\r\\nalso the minimum mapping consideration for the landuse categories of Extensive\\r\\nInstitutional (Code 125) and Park Lands (Code 175).\\xa0 The landuse/cover classification system is\\r\\nadapted from the USGS (Anderson) classification system, incorporating a mix of\\r\\nlevel I, II and III classes.\\xa0 There are a\\r\\ntotal of 25 categories in ARC's landuse/cover system (described below), 2 of\\r\\nwhich are used only for landuse designations: Park Lands (Code 175) and\\r\\nExtensive Institutional (Code 125).\\xa0 The\\r\\nother 23 categories can describe landuse and/or landcover, and in most cases\\r\\nwill be the same.\\xa0 The LU code will differ\\r\\nfrom the LC code only where the Park Lands (Code 175) and Extensive Institutional\\r\\n(Code 125) land holdings have been identified from collateral sources of land\\r\\nownership.<span style='font-size:9.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:\\r\\n&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:\\r\\n&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Although similar to previous eras of ARC landuse/cover databases\\r\\ndeveloped before 1999 (1995, 1990 etc.), &quot;LandPro&quot; differs in many\\r\\nsignificant ways. Originally, ARC's landuse and landcover database was built\\r\\nfrom 1975 data complied by USGS at scales of 1:100,000 and selectively,\\r\\n1:24,000.\\xa0 The coverage was updated in\\r\\n1990 using SPOT satellite imagery and low-altitude aerial photography and again\\r\\nin 1995 using 1:24,000 scale panchromatic aerial photography.\\xa0 Unlike these previous 5-year updates, the\\r\\n1999, 2001, 2003, 2005 and now 2007 LandPro databases were compiled at a larger\\r\\nscale (1:14,000) and do not directly reflect pre-1999 delineations.\\xa0 In addition, all components of LandPro were\\r\\nproduced using digital orthophotos for on-screen photo-interpretation and\\r\\ndigitizing, thus eliminating the use of unrectified photography and the need\\r\\nfor data transfer and board digitizing.\\xa0\\r\\nAs a result, the positional accuracy of LandPro is much higher than in\\r\\nprevious eras.\\xa0 There have also been some\\r\\nchanges to the classification system prior to 1999.\\xa0 Previously, three categories of Forest\\r\\n(41-deciduous, 42-coniferous, and 43-mixed forest) were used; this version does\\r\\nnot distinguish between coniferous and deciduous forest, thus Code 40 is used\\r\\nto simply designate Forest.\\xa0 Likewise,\\r\\ntwo categories of Wetlands (61-forested wetland, and 62-non-forested wetland)\\r\\nwere used before; this version does not distinguish between forested and\\r\\nnon-forested wetlands, thus Code 60 is used to simply designate Wetlands.\\xa0 With regard to Wetlands, the boundaries\\r\\nthemselves are now based on the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) delineations\\r\\nalong with the CIR imagery.\\xa0 Furthermore,\\r\\nCode 51 has been renamed &quot;Rivers&quot; from &quot;Streams and Canals&quot;\\r\\nand represents the Chattahoochee and Etowah Rivers which have been identified\\r\\nin the landuse/cover database.\\xa0 In\\r\\naddition to these changes, Code 52 has been dropped from the system as there\\r\\nare no known instances of naturally occurring lakes in the Region.

Stand delineation is based on the Photo Interpreter’s (PI) experience and judgment of separating image components into distinct areas of perceived spatial patterns and textural differences. Large continuous areas that have similar texture and characteristics defined through visual observation rarely to exceed 100 acres. Specific characteristics that defined a stand polygon is species composition, size class and stocking (SPSS) as well as significant changes in topography (slope and aspect) and operational boundaries (ridge lines, water courses, roads). The reservation boundary was used to define the extent of the project area. The current sub-watershed boundaries were used to divide the reservation into logical stand delineation areas. Stand Numbering designation is based on the township range and section forming the first 6 digites of the Stand ID followec by a unique stand number. Where stand numbering conflicted, a new stand number was utilized by adding an additional digit onto the end of the number. Additional editing and splitting of polygons was performed where needed, and each polygon typed with the vegetation type call. All Polygons were then merged to produce the overall stand data base into an ESRI Personal Geodatabase. Stand delineation and typing was performed on sub-watershed by delineating differences in vegetation cover and assigning a photo type call to the delineated polygon. This classification sets the four digit code establishing the PI’s best estimate of forest cover observable from remotely sensed data. Following is an SPSS list of the photo typing call identifiers that will be used to establish the four digit photo type code. The 2° code will only be used with 1° codes B_, C_, D_. The 2° code will signify the previous cover type in these cases (e.g., Bh = burned ponderosa pine).The following table identifies the 4 digit Vegetation label (Veg_Lbl) used in the typing calls.CodeDescriptionSize Class ID (S)Stocking ID (S)1°2°B_Burned + previous cover type0 = &lt;10% stocked or &lt;75TPA0 = N , &lt;10% areaC_Clearcut + Previous cover type1 = dbh 0-5” - Seedling/Sapling1 = Low, 10-39% areaD_Dead + Previous cover type2 = dbh 6-11” - Pole 2 = Medium 40-69% areaAFAsubalpine fir3 = dbh 12-21” - Small Saw log3 = High &gt; 70% areaDFBDouglas-fir4 = dbh 22+” - Large Saw logGFCgrand firHMDmountain or western hemlockLPElodgepole pineOHFother hardwoodsOOGOregon oakPPHponderosa pineSFIsilver firWBJwhitebark pineWLKwestern larchXBLbrushXMMmeadowXONopen (rock, water, glaciers)XROright-of-way/power linesData fields included in the “VegPoly” layer sre consistent with The Forester’s Guidebook, James D Arney, Ph.D, December 14, 2015 (Pages 41-51).

This update is timely for two reasons. First, traffic congestion has consistently ranked as the number one issue facing Tigard in community attitude surveys and the City is committed to finding solutions to this issue. Secondly, the community has developed a vision for Tigard's future and a key component of this vision is developing an efficient and balanced multi-modal transportation system.The 2035 TSP sets the policy framework for the city's transportation system. It includes a list of strategies and projects that will guide future investments. The strategies range from access management, to connectivity improvements, to &quot;smarter&quot; traffic signals. There are more than 140 identified transportation projects ranging from sidewalk infill to freeway over-passes. Identification of these transportation projects is important because in order to qualify for federal transportation funds they must be identified in the TSP.Transportation funds are limited and highly competitive for large expensive projects. For this reason, a major theme of this TSP update is the need to make the most out of the existing transportation system. We believe this can be accomplished through effective management and strategic investments such as improved street connections, new trails, sidewalks, bicycle facilities, intersection improvements, and transit service. All of these improvements are aimed at providing safe and efficient transportation options for the community.For general information visit the City's home page.

Digital multispectral images were collected by the multispectral scanner and thematic mapper sensors, allowing for large areas to be analyzed in the most time and cost efficient way. \\xa0The analysis was conducted using 2010 Landsat imagery in ERDASImagine. An unsupervised image classification was used, allowing us to automatically decide which pixels go into each class. In all, 50 classes were used, and sorted through to determine if each was a MTR or non-MTR site. Once completed, a reclassification tool was used in ArcGIS to reclassify the two categories. Eventually the raster was converted to a polygon, displaying only the MTR locations.\\xa0A major limitation to this analysis was the quality of the Landsat imagery. The group 3 study area had extensive cloud coverage that had similar spectral signature to an MTR site, which allowed for misclassifications. The variables used to remove certain areas did not account for the spectral reflectance of these clouds. Another limitation was the 2005 MTR locations, which had limited coverage of the group 3 area, creating a lack of comparison and therefore, decrease in the confidence level of correctly classifying the MTR sites. Many environmental and man-made features have similar spectral signatures to mining, such as roads and water bodies, otherwise known as interference features. To improve the quality of the classification by reducing this noise and interference, buffer systems were used on rivers and streets to remove all MTR sites within the overlap. (400m highways, 50m river, 50m streets) Lastly, all sites 40 acres and under were removed.With the final MTR layer complete, an accuracy check was performed by generating 30 random points and verifying if they were indeed MTR or non-MTR locations.\\xa0',\n",

       "  'dc_description_s': '   This map is a compiled group project of Group 1. There were 4 people in the group and we chose a certain area of our study area to focus on. The process to get the map to where it is took about 3 weeks to complete. For my portion of the map. I started out with four aerial images. I compiled the 4 images into one seamless photo. From there I took the image and loaded it into a program called ERDAS. Within ERDAS I analyzed the image which was broken down into 50 classes. I zoomed into the pixel level of each of the 50 classes and determined if it was a Mountain Top Removal (MTR) area or not.  Once that was completed I reclassified the image in ArcMap to two classes MTR and NonMTR areas. The new classified image was edited and the ending process of these edits were areas that are greater than 40 acres, areas within 50 meters of roads and rivers removed, areas within 400 meters of major rivers and highways were removed, and the new map only included areas that intersected mountain ridges. The map was then packaged and sent to the group leader, Jon Voiles. Jon then complied all the maps of the 4 members of the group and then sent it back to the group members as Final Compiled group MTR layer. \\nThis was a difficult project for me to do. There were several times that I would have to start the project completely over from scratch because things were just not working right.     On top of the issues I was having with the map I also traveled overseas during the course of the project and struggled to find internet and time to work on the project. I would often find myself using airport Wi-Fi and working on the project between flights. This project has taught me a lot and allowed me to use a lot of mapping programs and tools that I have not used before. \\n',\n",

Each MOE is expressed in the same units as its corresponding measure;\\nfor example, if the estimate value is expressed as a number, then its MOE will\\nalso be a number; if the estimate value is expressed as a percent, then its MOE\\nwill also be a percent.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe user should also note that for relatively\\nsmall geographic areas, such as census tracts shown here, ACS only releases\\ncombined 5-year estimates, meaning these estimates represent rolling averages\\nof survey results that were collected over a 5-year span (in this case\\n2013-2017).\\xa0Therefore, these data do not represent any one specific point\\nin time or even one specific year.\\xa0For geographic areas with larger\\npopulations, 3-year and 1-year estimates are also available.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nFor further explanation of ACS estimates and margin of error,\\nvisit Census ACS website.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nNaming conventions:\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n<table border='0'

The base data shows the locations of the emergency operation centers, fire stations, high schools, hospitals, parks, police stations, and streets. Also, the hosted feature layer contains incident data that can be utilized as point locations for essential spatial analysis during an emergency situation. The incident data is divided into four categories - fire incidents, natural disasters, police incidents, and terrorism events.Methods to Use the DataThe spatial and attribute information can be exported from this Item Details page or the file geodatabase that was used to create this hosted feature layer can be downloaded by navigating to the Item Details page for the file geodatabase titled\\xa0CAPSTONE - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT.',\n",

Although it has a landuse component which is used for forecasts and modeling at ARC, outside users should be aware that the landcover and landuse delineations are based on photo-interpretation of a 5-acre and 25-acre minimum mapping unit respectively, not parcels.  Likewise, LandPro2008 should not be taken out of its Regional context, though county-level or municipal-level analysis may be useful for transportation, environmental and landuse planning. LandPro2008 is ARC's landuse/landcover GIS database for the 20-county Atlanta Region (Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry, Rockdale, the EPA non-attainment (1hr standard) counties of Forsyth, Paulding and Coweta. and the EPA non-attainment (8hr standard) counties of Carroll, Barrow, Bartow, Hall, Newton, Spalding and Walton). LandPro2005 was created by on-screen photo-interpretation and digitizing of ortho-rectified aerial photography at a scale of 1:14,000.  The primary source for this GIS database was 2008 true color imagery with 1.64-foot pixel resolution, provided by Aerials Express, Inc.<span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Though\\r\\nthe terms are often used interchangeably, landuse and landcover are not\\r\\nsynonymous.\\xa0 Landcover generally refers\\r\\nto the natural or cultivated vegetation, rock, or water covering the land, as\\r\\nwell as the developed surface which can be identified on aerial\\r\\nphotography.\\xa0 Landuse generally refers to\\r\\nthe way that humans use or will use the land, regardless of its apparent\\r\\nlandcover.\\xa0 Collateral data for the\\r\\nlandcover mapping effort included the Aero Surveys of Georgia street atlas, the\\r\\nGeorgia Department of Community Affairs (DCA) Community Facilities database and\\r\\nthe USGS Digital Raster Graphics (DRGs) of 1:24,000 scale topographic maps.\\xa0 The landuse component of this database was\\r\\nadded after the landcover interpretation was completed, and is based primarily\\r\\non ownership information provided by the 20 counties and the City of Atlanta\\r\\nfor larger tracts of undeveloped land that meet the landuse definition of\\r\\n&quot;Extensive Institutional&quot;

differs in many significant ways.\\r\\nOriginally, ARC's landuse and landcover database was built from 1975 data\\r\\ncomplied by USGS at scales of 1:100,000 and selectively, 1:24,000.\\xa0 The coverage was updated in 1990 using SPOT\\r\\nsatellite imagery and low-altitude aerial photography and again in 1995 using\\r\\n1:24,000 scale panchromatic aerial photography.\\xa0\\r\\nUnlike these previous 5-year updates, the 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007\\r\\nand now 2008 LandPro databases were compiled at a larger scale (1:14,000) and\\r\\ndo not directly reflect pre-1999 delineations.\\xa0\\r\\nIn addition, all components of LandPro were produced using digital\\r\\northophotos for on-screen photo-interpretation and digitizing, thus eliminating\\r\\nthe use of unrectified photography and the need for data transfer and board\\r\\ndigitizing.\\xa0 As a result, the positional\\r\\naccuracy of LandPro is much higher than in previous eras.\\xa0 There have also been some changes to the\\r\\nclassification system prior to 1999.\\xa0\\r\\nPreviously, three categories of Forest (41-deciduous, 42-coniferous, and\\r\\n43-mixed forest) were used; this version does not distinguish between\\r\\nconiferous and deciduous forest, thus Code 40 is used to simply designate\\r\\nForest.\\xa0 Likewise, two categories of Wetlands\\r\\n(61-forested wetland, and 62-non-forested wetland) were used before; this\\r\\nversion does not distinguish between forested and non-forested wetlands, thus\\r\\nCode 60 is used to simply designate Wetlands.\\xa0\\r\\nWith regard to Wetlands, the boundaries themselves are now based on the\\r\\nNational Wetlands Inventory (NWI) delineations along with the CIR imagery.\\xa0 Furthermore, Code 51 has been renamed\\r\\n&quot;Rivers&quot; from &quot;Streams and Canals&quot; and represents the\\r\\nChattahoochee and Etowah Rivers which have been identified in the landuse/cover\\r\\ndatabase.\\xa0 In addition to these changes,\\r\\nCode 52 has been dropped from the system as there are no known instances of\\r\\nnaturally occurring lakes in the Region. Finally, the landuse code for Park\\r\\nLands has been changed from 173 to 175 so as to minimize confusion with the\\r\\nParks landcover code, 173.\\xa0 There has\\r\\nbeen a change in the agriculture classification for LandPro2005 and any LandPro\\r\\ndatasets hereafter.\\xa0 Previously, four\\r\\ncatagories of agriculture (21- agriculture-cropland and pasture, 22 -\\r\\nagriculture - orchards, 23 - agriculture - confined feeding operations and 24 -\\r\\nagriculture - other) were used; this version does not distinguish between the\\r\\ndifferent agricultural lands.\\xa0 Code 20 is\\r\\nnow used to designate agriclture. Due to new technology and the enhancements to\\r\\nthis database, direct comparison between LandPro99, LandPro2001, LandPro2003\\r\\nand landPro2005 is now possible, with the 1999 database serving as ARC's new\\r\\nbaseline.\\xa0 Please note that as a result\\r\\nof the 2003 mapping effort, LandPro2001 has been adjusted for better comparison\\r\\nto LandPro2003 and is named &quot;LandPro01_adj.&quot;\\xa0 Lilkewise, LandPro99 was previously adjusted\\r\\nwhen LandPro2001 was completed, but was not further adjusted following the 2003\\r\\nupdate.\\xa0 Although some adjustments were\\r\\noriginally made to the 1995 landuse/cover database for modeling applications,\\r\\ndirect comparisons to previous versions of ARC landuse/cover before 1999 should\\r\\nbe avoided in most cases.<span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Classification\\r\\nSystem:\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>111:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Low Density Single Family Residential -\\r\\nAreas that have generally been developed for single family residential use,\\r\\nusually with a significant mix of forested or agricultural landcover.\\xa0 These areas often occur on the periphery of\\r\\nurban expansion and are generally characterized by houses on 2 to 5 acre\\r\\nlots.\\xa0 Some examples of this category include\\r\\nrural housing, estates, and linear residential developments along\\r\\ntransportation routes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>112:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Medium Density Single Family Residential -\\r\\nAreas that have predominantly been developed for single family residential use,\\r\\nwith or without a significant mix of forested or agricultural landcover.\\xa0 These areas usually occur in urban or\\r\\nsuburban zones and are generally characterized by houses on 1/4 to 2 acre\\r\\nlots.\\xa0 This category accounts for the\\r\\nmajority of residential landuse in the Region and includes a wide variety of\\r\\nneighborhood types.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\\r\\nnormal'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\\r\\nmso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>113:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 High Density Residential -

Finally, the\\r\\nlanduse code for Park Lands has been changed from 173 to 175 so as to minimize\\r\\nconfusion with the Parks landcover code, 173.\\xa0\\r\\nThere has been a change in the agriculture classification for\\r\\nLandPro2005 and any LandPro datasets hereafter.\\xa0\\r\\nPreviously, four catagories of agriculture (21- agriculture-cropland and\\r\\npasture, 22 -

The CAD file was created by digitizing the RICA Maps of Pompeii, 1984, supported by World Monuments Watch and funded by American Express. The RICA MAPs were drawn in part from aerial images taken at 820m and supplemented by on the ground survey. Inconsistencies among the features of this layer with satellite imagery or other maps of Pompeii may be the result of errors in the rectification of the original aerial images and differences projected between coordinate systems (PBMP data are in the Monte_Mario_Italy_2 projected coordinate system). On the creation of the RICA Maps, see Van der Poel, H. B., Corpus Topographicum Pompeianum, vol. IIIA. Austin, TX, 1986, XI-XIX.\\n\\nTopologies: Individual features of this feature class are arranged so that their order produces best the visibility and relationships of all. That order, from uppermost to lowermost, is as follows: Buildings, Fortifications, Gates, Fountains, Water Towers, City Blocks, Forum, Unexcavated Areas, Projected City Blocks. \\n\\nSymbologies: This feature class is supported by a Layer file of the same name that contains its symbologies (multiple), display transparency (40%), and scale visibilities (none). \\n\\nCredits: This data was produced by Eric Poehler for the Pompeii Bibliography and Mapping Project after original CAD data provided by the Soprintendenza di Pompei.\\n',\n",

This group anticipated finding accurate information on wind energy facilities and turbines in the public sphere, like the type of data available for oil and gas wells. However, turbine information was lacking, and it became apparent that scientists, regulatory agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and other decision-makers all needed spatially accurate wind turbine information. Each of the 3,230 turbine locations includes corresponding facility information and turbine technical specifications.Electric substations are facilities and equipment that switch, transform or regulate electric voltage. The electric substation feature class in this service includes taps, which are locations where power on a transmission line is tapped by another transmission line. Electric substations are part of the electric network system helping to move electricity\\xa0to where it is needed.Electric power transmission lines are the system of structures, wires, insulators and associated hardware that carry electric power from one point to another in an electric power network. Lines are operated at high voltages varying from 69 kV (Kilo Volts) up to 765 kV and can transmit large quantities of electricity over long distances.

       "  'dc_description_s': \"The ABMIw2wLCV2010 was derived by applying a semantic and spatial generalization algorithm (Castilla et al., in preparation), and later updating to 2010 conditions, to a combination of two raster datasets: the Canadian Forest Service (CFS) Earth Observation for Sustainable Development (EOSD) LC dataset, and the Land Cover for Agricultural Regions of Canada, circa 2000 (LCARC, a.k.a. NLWIS) dataset of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC). Both datasets were created using digital classification of Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 ortho-images acquired around year 2000, with each Landsat scene classified individually and then mosaicked into the final raster product. NB. Both rasters use the same hierachical classification scheme. This feature class was obtained by merging 48 individual tiles whose frames are provided in the ABMIw2wLCV2000_48tiles feature class. Each tile is completely within a single Landsat scene, and its boundary roughly coincides with the seam lines used to stitch together the EOSD. Each map tile was created as follows:(0) The EOSD and NLWIS rasters were combined into a single raster according to a ruleset that selects a label for each pixel based on the values for that pixel in the two rasters. See the description of the SOURCE* fields in the ABMIw2wLCV2000_48tiles for further details. Lakes, rivers, pipelines, powerlines, railways and roads from the Government of Alberta (GoA) GIS layers were also 'burned' in this combined raster.(1) A morphological segmentation algorithm is applied to the gradient magnitude (a sort of 'edge' image) of the original Landsat image used to derive the EOSD, in order to break it down into a mosaic of tiny homogeneous regions (mean segment size around 10 pixels) separated by 1-pixel thick boundaries. NB. The edges of the features copied from the GoA's layers area are enhanced in the gradient magnitude image so as to preserve their shape in the output segmentation.(2)Regions having a clearly predominant landcover class ( more than 75% of its pixels belong to that class) are assigned to it, and adjacent regions having the same class are merged together. This results in a big portion of the image (usually more than 90%) being already labeled.(3)Endmembers, or typical spectral signatures (i.e., mean value in each band of the Landsat image) for each class are derived from these regions. (4)Unlabeled regions are assigned to the class of the most similar neighbour, providing the latter is already classified and bears enough similarity to it, ortherwise they are assigned to the class with the highest relative abundace within the region, where the latter is abundance weighted by distance in the feature space between the spectral signature of the region and the endmember of each class. Once again, adjacent regions having the same class are merged together after the assigment. NB. There are special rules on how to deal with semantically related classes, such as conifer, broadleaf and mixed forest. (5) Regions are reclassified into the final set of 11 landcover classes using a predefined crosswalk table, after which adjacent regions having the same class are merged together. NB. Treed wetlands (class 81 in EOSD) greater than 100 ha are assumed to be black spruce and thus conifer. Smaller treed wetlands are assigned to the class of the closest forest endmembers.(6) Regions smaller than the minimum mapping unit (MMU: 0.5 ha for water and 2 ha for the rest) are merged to their most similar adjacent neighbour. (7) Isolated regions smaller than 25 ha that show a low contrast with the encompassing region were eliminated, as they were found in a previous version to mainly correspond to spurious polygons.(8) Using the center of boundary pixels as initial vertices, the result is converted to an ESRI polygon shapefile using a line simplification algorithm. Once all tiles were ready, the final product was created by merging and dissolving the individual tiles into a seamless layer. After dissolving, a few seam lines were still visible due to differing classifications in the adjoining tiles. The labels of polygons affected by these inconsistencies were harmonized using semi-automated GIS procedures, after which a final 'dissolve' was performed.The circa 2000 map was updated to circa 2010 conditions using a hybrid procedure that included a combination of change detection and GIS techniques. The map was updated for new features appearing in the 2000-2010 period of the following types: forestry cutblocks, wildfires, surface mines, roads and urban development. Cutblocks were extracted from the cumulative ABMI cutblock layer. A difference image (NDVI2000 – NDVI2010) was computed, and statistics for each cutblock polygon were derived. Cutblocks harvested between 2000 and 2010 were preselected by thresholding and those close to the threshold were visually inspected before the final selection. The wildfires were extracted from GoA’s Historical Wildfire Perimeter Dataset using a similar procedure than for the cutblocks. Mines, roads and urban were extracted from the 2010 ABMI Human Footprint dataset using GIS overlay operations that compared these with preexisting features of this type in the 2000 map. The different types of new features were integrated into a single disturbance layer, the outlines of this layer were generalized to give them a similar appearance than those of the 2000 map, the disturbance layer was stamped on top of the 2000 map, and slivers (small polygons resulting from boundary mistmatches) were removed. The Landcover_Polygons_2010 feature class has a new field called ‘MOD_TY’ (modifier type) that records the type of disturbance a new polygon not belonging to the developed class is. Possible values are ‘Cutblock’, ‘Burnt’, ‘Mining’ and ‘Tailing pond’ (the latter belongs to water class). NB. Cutblocks, mines and other disturbance features that already existed in 2000 have their MOD_TY field blank in this version.Landcover class definitions (field LC_class):20 - Water: lakes, lagoons, rivers, canals, and artificial water bodies. Shallow open water is included in this category, unless there is more than 20% vegetation cover, in which case it belongs to the relevant vegetated class.31 - Snow/Ice: areas permanently covered by snow or ice, including glaciers. 32 - Rock/Rubble: bedrock, rubble, talus, blockfield, lava beds, or other natural impervious surfaces. 33 - Exposed Land: bare soil (barren, non-agricultural), river sediments and cutbanks, pond or lake sediments, reservoir margins, beaches, landings, fresh (less than 1yr) cutblocks, recently burned areas, mudflat sediments, surface mining, or other non-vegetated (less than 10% trees, or less than 20% shrub/herb) surfaces. 34 - Developed: urban and built-up areas (including industrial sites), impervious artificial surfaces (e.g. airport runaways), railways and roads. Acreages and farmsteads are included in this class. Oil and gas well pads are included in this class if connected to a road and not abandoned or under reclamation. Urban terrain under development is included in this class, even if the land is exposed. Urban green areas are excluded of this class if larger than 2 ha and if they have less than 2 buildings per hectare. 50 - Shrubland: At least 20% ground cover which is at least one-third shrub (shrub: a woody plant not considered a tree), with no or little presence of trees (less than10% crown closure). Examples of plants belonging to this class in Alberta are alder, willow, juniper, and sagebrush. Shrubby fens and other non-treed woody wetlands, usually associated with floodplains and the shores of lakes and streams, belong to this class. Recent clearcuts and forest fires are initially labeled as shrubland to differntiate them from the surrounding forest.110 - Grassland: Predominantly native grasses and other non-woody vegetation (e.g., forbs) with a minimum of 20% ground cover. May include some shrub cover (but less than a third of the vegetated area) or a few trees (but the tree cover cannot exceed 10%). Land used for range with native unimproved grasses (a.k.a. rough pasture) is included in this class. Alpine meadows fall into this class. Marshes and other non-woody wetlands with at least 20% vegetation cover (sedges, cattails, or moss) belong to this class. NB. A forestry cutblock harvested more than year ago that contains seedlings, but where the latter cover less than 10% of the area of the cutblock, belongs to this class. If the cutblock had no successful regeneration and was covered by more than 20% shrubs, then it would belong to the 'shrubland' class.120 - Agriculture: annually cultivated crops, tame pastures (fields planted or sown with non-native grasses/legumes where livestock is directly grazing on them in the summer), forage crops (same as the previous, but instead of grazed, cut for hay) and woody perennial crops (fruit orchards and vineyards). Bare agricultural (i.e., tilled) soil belongs to this class and not to 'exposed land'.210 - Coniferous Forest: Treed areas with at least a 10% ground cover of trees (a.k.a. crown closure), where coniferous trees (spruce, pine, fir, larch) are 75% or more of the crown closure. Young plantations or regenerating cutblocks of conifer trees belong to this class no matter that the trees are less than 5 m tall, providing crown closure has reached 10%. Treed wetlands (e.g., black spruce bogs and fens) are included in this class providing they are conifer dominated and crown closure exceeds10%.220 - Broadleaf Forest: Treed areas with at least a 10% ground cover of trees, where broadleaf trees (trembling aspen, balsam poplar, white birch) are 75% or more of the crown closure. Young plantations or regenerating cutblocks of broadleaf trees belong to this class no matter that the trees are less than 5 m tall, providing crown closure has reached 10%. Treed swamps along river floodplains and other treed wetlands are included in this class providing they are broadleaf dominated and crown closure exceeds 10%.230 - Mixed Forest: Treed areas with at least a 10% ground cover of trees, where neither coniferous nor broadleaf trees account for 75% or more of crown closure.The overall thematic accuracy of the map, as estimated by an extensive validation dataset (see description of the relevant feature class) is 75% with 11 classes, and 88% if these classes are grouped into 5 general classes. User and Producer accuracies for specific classes in each level appear in tables appended to this geodatabase. Caveats:The width of roads has been systematically exaggerated to a minimum of 60 m (two Landsat pixels); therefore the real extent of the Developed class is greatly overestimated.Forest areas harvested or burned between 2000 and 2010 were assigned to the ‘Shrub’ LC class to differentiate them from their surroundings. They can be identified using the ‘MOD_TY’ field, which will respectively contain the value ‘Cutblock’ or ‘Burnt’.The accuracy of the shrub class is low (30%). Many shrub polygons are in reality forest (beyond new cutblocks and burnt areas), especially in the North. This was not possible to correct with the input data at hand.\",\n",

The data is intended to be\\nused as a tool for water-resource management and planning activities,\\nparticularly for site-specific and localized studies requiring a level of\\ndetail provided by large-scale map information. The Watershed Boundary Dataset\\n(WBD) defines the areal extent of surface water drainage to a point, accounting\\nfor all land and surface areas. Watershed Boundaries are determined solely upon\\nscience-based hydrologic principles, not favoring any administrative boundaries\\nor special projects, nor particular program or agency. The intent of defining\\nHydrologic Units (HU) for the Watershed Boundary Dataset is to establish a\\nbaseline drainage boundary framework, accounting for all land and surface areas.\\nAt a minimum, the WBD is being delineated and georeferenced to the USGS\\n1:24,000 scale topographic base map meeting National Map Accuracy Standards\\n(NMAS). Hydrologic units are given a Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC). For example, a\\nhydrologic region has a 2-digit HUC. A HUC describes where the unit is in the\\ncountry and the level of the unit. The document &quot;Federal Standards and\\nProcedures for the National Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD)&quot; can be\\nfound\\xa0here. ‘A hydrologic unit is a drainage area delineated to\\nnest in a multi-level, hierarchical drainage system. Its boundaries\\nare\\xa0defined by hydrographic and topographic criteria that delineate an\\narea of land upstream from a specific point on a river, stream or similar\\nsurface waters. A hydrologic unit can accept surface water directly from\\nupstream drainage areas, and indirectly from associated surface areas such as\\nremnant, non-contributing, and diversions to form a drainage area with single\\nor multiple outlet points.

Before January 1, 2017, all companies had to file an application with TTB and receive permission before producing wine for commercial purposes (not for personal or family use). When that application was approved, the wine producers would attain the status of &quot;bonded wine producers&quot;.

This process where you match up a GIS layer's information and analyze it to show suitability for the submarine could be repeated over many different information sources.\\xa0Methodology:This product is part of a demonstration that shows how you can create an overall suitability by using different GIS layers and relating the information in those layers to physical parameters of a vessel and human intent of the commander. For instance, a submarine has physical parameters that could be analyzed, and a product showing how the submarine will perform could be created. There is also commander's intent, which maps behavioral intent of human to a model place on the earth. For instance, this could be that a submarine commander would not want to be spotted, so there is a commander's intent to avoid likely traffic patterns of vessels.\\xa0The\\xa0North Korean Submarine Suitability products use many different GIS data sources to come up with an overall suitability of operations.\\xa0Operating Depth RestrictionsBy using bathymetry data, a suitability product that shows different areas that a submarine could go. In the image below, green areas are areas below the periscope depth of the submarine and have a high likelihood that submarines would be in these areas. Yellow areas are at periscope depth, and red areas are too shallow for the submarine, or, the submarine is on the surface.Maritime Boundary SuitabilityBy using a layer that shows each country's maritime boundary, a suitability product could be created to map commander's intent of protecting that boundary. For instance, a commander would have a higher likelihood of protecting an area that the country owns, versus operating close to shore in another country's waters for fear that the submarine could be detected. In the image below, green areas are North Korean claims, yellow areas are not claimed, or, are disputed territories, and orange and red areas are claimed by other nations.Mixed Layer Depth SuitabilityBy using ocean temperature information, a product that shows mixed layer depth suitability could be created. In the ocean column, the mixed layer depth is an area where the ocean temperature by winds, currents, and other parameters, has caused a relatively constant area of temperature. In submarine operations, submariners want to operate in areas where the sound profile is not pronounced and this means operating in areas that are not mixed. In the image below, areas that are beneficial to submarine operations in respect to mixed layer depth are shown in green, while poor areas are shown in red.Seafloor Sediment SuitabilityBy using seafloor sediment data, a product could be created that shows where a submarine could bottom. Sediment data describes the ocean floor environment from a geological\\xa0perspective. Some areas could have a consistency of boulders, others could have sand and others could be silt or mud. The product below describes areas where a submarine could bottom, which are areas of sand and small pebbles, and not silty or prevalent with boulders.Choke PointsChoke points are areas that cause moving items to bunch due to physical structure of the environment. A country layer could be used for the analysis where island areas close to each other but wide enough for a group of ships to pass through would be output in the result. In submarine operations, the submariner would want to operate near choke points. In the image below, areas that are wide enough for a carrier strike group are shown in dark red.\\xa0Submarine Canyons AnalysisBy using bathymetry data, a product could be created that shows areas of submarine canyons not deeper than the operational depth constraints of the submarine could be created. Canyon areas are significant for submarines as they are areas that are hard for an adversary to detect the submarine's presence. Areas of canyons are seen in the ocean basemap in the image below.\\xa0Shipping Traffic DensityShipping traffic density can be calculated from ship automatic identification system (AIS) position reports. An analysis of many ship AIS positions could be created to show areas of likely traffic patterns and density. In regards to submarine operations, submarine commanders would be likely to avoid areas of high ship presence.\\xa0Waves AnalysisWave data products could be used to understand where submarines are likely to operate. Areas of high waves (surface and internal ocean waves) are not good for the submarine, which are shown in the image below in red, while suitable areas are in blue.\\xa0Submarine Operations SuitabilityThe overall submarine operations suitability is created by analyzing each of the products above and merging them into a single, overall product. The individual parts could be weighted in different ways, depending on how the analysts wants the analysis to run, or, the operations conditions of the environment. Below is the model that was used to analyze all the individual parts above and sum them together for the overall suitability.\\xa0\",\n",

CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters:\\n- 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature\\n- minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares\\n- minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres\\n- minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares\\n\\nCLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc..  CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.

To do so it relates indigenous and local communities to the\\nmountain range they inhabit and identifies some of their specific\\ncharacteristics. The comprehensive database of information on indigenous and local communities living in mountain areas that supports this application is the\\nfirst of its kind.Please note that both the database and the map are work in progress,\\nand are meant to be used as a baseline for future mapping and research. The\\ndatabase will be updated as more information pertaining to mountain ranges, indigenous and local mountain peoples is provided to the Mountain Partnership Secretariat\\nteam.\\xa0Authors:This interactive map is the result of a collaboration between\\nthe\\xa0Mountain\\nPartnership\\xa0and the\\xa0Global Mountain Biodiversity\\nAssessment (GMBA). GMBA provided the mountain ranges layer and the\\nMountain Partnership collected information on indigenous and local mountain peoples and\\ndeveloped the Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities web app.About the layer:The delineation of mountain regions used for this application is a\\nmodified version of GMBA’s global inventory of the worlds’ mountains\\n(Körner et al. 2017). Modifications were performed based on the\\xa0GMBA\\nMountain Inventory V1.2\\xa0in order to accommodate differences\\nbetween the\\xa0mountain definition\\xa0applied by GMBA (Körner et al. 2011) and the\\xa0Kapos et al.\\xa0definition adopted by the Mountain Partnership.Each of the &gt;1000 mountain ranges included in the original GMBA\\nmountain inventory (Körner et al. 2017) is delineated by a polygon and\\nprovided with a name.

This group anticipated finding accurate information on wind energy facilities and turbines in the public sphere, like the type of data available for oil and gas wells. However, turbine information was lacking, and it became apparent that scientists, regulatory agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and other decision-makers all needed spatially accurate wind turbine information. Each of the 8,012 turbine locations includes corresponding facility information and turbine technical specifications.Electric substations are facilities and equipment that switch, transform or regulate electric voltage. The electric substation feature class in this service includes taps, which are locations where power on a transmission line is tapped by another transmission line. Electric substations are part of the electric network system helping to move electricity\\xa0to where it is needed.Electric power transmission lines are the system of structures, wires, insulators and associated hardware that carry electric power from one point to another in an electric power network. Lines are operated at high voltages varying from 69 kV (Kilo Volts) up to 765 kV and can transmit large quantities of electricity over long distances. The underground transmission\\xa0lines are included where sources were available.Wind Energy InfrastructureData currency: March 2, 2014 (Turbines) and August 08, 2017 (Electric Substations and Transmission Lines)Data sources:\\xa0Onshore Industrial Wind Turbine\\xa0Locations\\xa0and\\xa0Electric Substations\\xa0and\\xa0Electric Power Transmission LinesFor more information, please visit:\\xa0Data Series 817\\xa0and\\xa0HIFLDFor feedback:\\xa0ArcGIScomNationalMaps@esri.comThumbnail source image courtesy of:\\xa0Thomas KohlerOther Federal User Community federally focused content that may interest youDepartment of the Interior\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0U.S. Geological Survey\\xa0Open Data:\\xa0USDOI\\xa0 or\\xa0USDHS\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0U.S. Geological Survey\\xa0or\\xa0HIFLDDepartment of Homeland Security\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Homeland Infrastructure Foundation Level Data\\xa0\\xa0',\n",

Royce and published as the second part of the two-part Eighteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, 1896-1897 have been scanned, georeferenced in JPEG2000 format, and digitized to create this feature class of cession maps. The mapped cessions and reservations included in the 67 maps correspond to entries in the Schedule of Indian Land Cessions, “indicating the number and location of each cession by or reservation for the Indian tribes from the organization of the Federal Government to and including 1894, together with descriptions of the tracts so ceded or reserved, the date of the treaty, law or executive order governing the same, the name of the tribe or tribes affected thereby, and historical data and references bearing thereon,” as set forth in the subtitle of the Schedule. Go to this URL for full metadata: http://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.TRIBALCEDEDLANDS.xml Each Royce map was georeferenced against one or more of the following USGS 1:2,000,000 National Atlas Feature Classes contained in \\\\NatlAtlas_USGS.gdb: cities_2mm, hydro_ln_2mm, hydro_pl_2mm, plss_2mm, states_2mm. Cessions were digitized as a file geodatabase (GDB) polygon feature class, projected as NAD83 USA_Contiguous_Lambert_Conformal_Conic, which is the same projection used to georeference the maps. The feature class was later reprojected to WGS 1984 Web Mercator (auxiliary sphere) to optimize it for the Tribal Connections Map Viewer. Polygon boundaries were digitized as to not deviate from the drawn polygon edge to the extent that space could be seen between the digitized polygon and the mapped polygon at a viewable scale. Topology was maintained between coincident edges of adjacent polygons. The cession map number assigned by Royce was entered into the feature class as a field attribute. The Map Cession ID serves as the link referencing relationship classes and joining additional attribute information to 752 polygon features, to include the following: 1. Data transcribed from Royce’s Schedule of Indian Land Cessions: a. Date(s), in the case of treaties, the date the treaty was signed, not the date of the proclamation; b. Tribe(s), the tribal name(s) used in the treaty and/or the Schedule; and c. Map Name(s), the name of the map(s) on which a cession number appears; 2. URLs for the corresponding entry in the Schedule of Indian Land Cessions (Internet Archive) for each unique combination of a Date and reference to a Map Cession ID (historical references in the Schedule are included); 3. URLs for the corresponding treaty text, including the treaties catalogued by Charles J. Kappler in Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties (HathiTrust Digital Library), executive order or other federal statute (Library of Congress and University of Georgia) identified in each entry with a reference to a Map Cession ID or IDs; 4. URLs for the image of the Royce map(s) (Library of Congress) on which a given cession number appears; 5. The name(s) of the Indian tribe or tribes related to each mapped cession, including the name as it appeared in the Schedule or the corresponding primary text, as well as the name of the present-day Indian tribe or tribes; and 6. The present-day states and counties included wholly or partially within a Map Cession boundary. During the 2017-2018 revision of the attribute data, it was noted that 7 of the Cession Map IDs are missing spatial representation in the Feature Class. The missing data is associated with the following Cession Map IDs: 47 (Illinois 1), 65 (Tennessee and Bordering States), 128 (Georgia), 129 (Georgia), 130 (Georgia), 543 (Indian Territory 3), and 690 (Iowa 2), which will be updated in the future. This dataset revises and expands the dataset published in 2015 by the U.S. Forest Service and made available through the Tribal Connections viewer, the Forest Service Geodata Clearinghouse, and Data.gov. The 2018 dataset is a result of collaboration between the Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, Office of Tribal Relations (OTR); the Department of the Interior, National Park Service, National NAGPRA Program; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of International and Tribal Affairs, American Indian Environmental Office; and Dr. Claudio Saunt of the University of Georgia. The Forest Service and Dr. Saunt independently digitized and georeferenced the Royce cession maps and developed online map viewers to display Native American land cessions and reservations. Dr. Saunt subsequently undertook additional research to link Schedule entries, treaty texts, federal statutes and executive orders to cession and reservation polygons, which he agreed to share with the U.S. Forest Service. OTR revised the data, linking the Schedule entries, treaty texts, federal statues and executive orders to all 1,172 entries in the attribute table. The 2018 dataset has incorporated data made available by the National NAGPRA Program, specifically the Indian tribe or tribes related to each mapped cession, including the name as it appeared in the Schedule or the corresponding primary text and the name of the present-day Indian tribe or tribes, as well as the present-day states and counties included wholly or partially within a Map Cession boundary. This data replaces in its entirety the National NAGPRA data included in the dataset published in 2015. The 2015 dataset incorporated data presented in state tables compiled from the Schedule of Indian Land Cessions by the National NAGPRA Program. In recent years the National NAGPRA Program has been working to ensure the accuracy of this data, including the reevaluation of the present-day Indian tribes and the provision of references for their determinations. Changes made by the OTR have not been reviewed or approved by the National NAGPRA Program. The Forest Service will continue to collaborate with other federal agencies and work to improve the accuracy of the data included in this dataset. Errors identified since the dataset was published in 2015 have been corrected, and we request that you notify us of any additional errors we may have missed or that have been introduced. Please contact Rebecca Hill, Policy Analyst, U.S. Forest Service, Office of Tribal Relations, at rebeccahill@fs.fed.us with any questions or concerns with regard to the data included in this dataset.\\xa0',\n",

The first is the definition of space and function developed by Eschebach (final description in Eschebach, H., L. Eschebach, and J. Müller-Trollius, Gebäudeverzeichnis und Stadtplan der antiken Stadt Pompeji (Köln) 1993). The second is the CAD file provided by the Soprintendenza di Pompei to Eric Poehler in 2003. The CAD file was created by digitizing the RICA Maps of Pompeii, 1984, supported by World Monuments Watch and funded by American Express. The RICA MAPs were drawn in part from aerial images taken at 820m and supplemented by on the ground survey. Inconsistencies among the features of this layer with satellite imagery or other maps of Pompeii may be the result of errors in the rectification of the original aerial images and differences projected between coordinate systems (PBMP data are in the Monte_Mario_Italy_2 projected coordinate system). On the creation of the RICA Maps, see Van der Poel, H. B., Corpus Topographicum Pompeianum, vol. IIIA. Austin, TX, 1986, XI-XIX.\\xa0Topologies: Individual features of this feature class are arranged so that their order produces best the visibility and relationships of all. That order, from uppermost to lowermost, is as follows: Entertainment Buildings, Workshops, Shops, Guilds, Market Garden, Private Dwellings, Public Buildings, Temples, Urban Supply System, Unknown.\\xa0\\nSymbologies: This feature class contains symbologies (multiple), display transparency (40%), and scale visibilities (none).\\xa0Credits: These data were produced by Eric Poehler for the Pompeii Bibliography and Mapping Project after original CAD data provided by the Soprintendenza di Pompei.',\n",

The U.S. natural gas pipeline network is a highly integrated\\xa0network that moves natural gas throughout the continental United States. The pipeline network has about 3 million miles of mainline and other pipelines that link natural gas production areas and storage facilities with consumers. This natural gas transportation network delivered more than 25 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of natural gas in 2016 to about 74 million customers.There are two types of natural gas networks within the United States. The largest system is the interstate pipeline system which means the pipelines cross one or more states. Two-thirds of the lower 48 States are almost totally dependent upon the interstate pipeline system for their supplies of natural gas. Today, almost every major metropolitan area in the United States is supplied by, or is the final destination of, one or more of the major interstate pipeline companies or their affiliates.The other type of natural gas pipelines existing within the United States are the intrastate natural gas pipeline networks. Intrastate natural gas pipelines operate within State borders and link natural gas producers to local markets and to the interstate pipeline network. Approximately 29 percent of the total miles of natural gas pipelines in the U.S. are intrastate pipelines. Although an intrastate pipeline system is defined as one that operates totally within a State, an intrastate pipeline company may have operations in more than one State. As long as these operations are separate, that is, they do not physically interconnect, they are considered intrastate, and are not jurisdictional\\xa0to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). More than 90 intrastate natural gas pipelines operate in the lower 48 States.\\xa0The source pipeline data was created by EIA using publicly available data from a variety of sources with varying scales and levels of accuracy.Interstate and Intrastate Gas PipelinesData currency: April, 19, 2018Data Download:\\xa0MAPSFor more information, please visit:\\xa0Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline Segment\\xa0and\\xa0Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline SegmentFor feedback please contact:\\xa0ArcGIScomNationalMaps@esri.comThumbnail image courtesy of\\xa0NPCA OnlineOther Federal User Community federally focused content that may interest you\\xa0U.S. Department of Energy\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Energy Information Administration\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: USDOE\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: EIA\\xa0',\n",

(Studio sulle provenienze degli oggetti rinvenuti negli scavi borbonici del Regno di Napoli: Una lettura integrata, coordinata e commentata della documentazione, 2 vols. Castellamare di Stabia: N. Longobardi) and digitized by students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Spatial data in this layer are based on a CAD file provided by the Soprintendenza di Pompei to Eric Poehler in 2003. The CAD file was created by digitizing the RICA Maps of Pompeii, 1984, supported by World Monuments Watch and funded by American Express. The RICA MAPs were drawn in part from aerial images taken at 820m and supplemented by on the ground survey. Inconsistencies among the features of this layer with satellite imagery or other maps of Pompeii may be the result of errors in the rectification of the original aerial images and differences projected between coordinate systems (PBMP data are in the Monte_Mario_Italy_2 projected coordinate system). On the creation of the RICA Maps, see Van der Poel, H. B., Corpus Topographicum Pompeianum, vol. IIIA. Austin, TX, 1986, XI-XIX.\\xa0Symbologies: This feature class is symboloized as a blue (Lapis lazuli) star (Asterisk 3) at 10 pt size, with no display transparency, and scale visibility set to not above 1:10,000.',\n",

EmergencyE911_RDS was originally derived from RDSnn (now called TransRoad_RDS). &quot;Zero-length ranges&quot; in the ROADS layer pertain to grand-fathered towns that have not yet provided the Enhanced 9-1-1 Board road segment range information. RDSnn was originally developed using a combination of paper and RC Kodak RF 5000 orthophotos (visual image interpretation and manual digitizing of centerlines). Road attributes (RTNO and CLASS) were taken from the official VT Agency of Transportation (VTrans) highway maps. New roads not appearing on the photos were digitized with locations approximated from the VTrans highway maps. State Forest maps were used to determine both location and attributes of state forest roads. Some data updates have used RF 2500 or RF 1250 orthophotos and GPS, or other means for adding new roads and improving road locations. The Enhanced E911 program added new roads from GPS and orthos between 1996-1998. Also added road name and address geocoding. VCGI PROCESSING (Tiling and Added items); E911 provides the EmergencyE911_RDS data to VCGI in a statewide format. It lacks FIPS6 coding, making it difficult to extract data on the basis of town/county boundaries. As a result, VCGI has added FIPS6 to the attribute table. This field was originally populated by extracting MCODE value from RDNAME and relating to TBPOLY.PAT to bring over matching MCODE values. FIPS6 problems along the interstates and &quot;Gores &amp; Grants&quot; in the Northeast Kingdom, were corrected. All features with an MCODE equal to 200 or 579 were assigned a FIPS6 equal to 0. The center point of these arcs were then intersected with BoundaryTown_TBHASH to assign a FIPS6 value. This information was then transfered back into the RDS.AAT file via a relate. A relate was established between the ROADNAMES.DBF file (road name lookup table) and the RDS.AAT file. The RDFLNAME attribute was populated by transfering the NAME value in the ROADNAMES.DBF table. The RDFLNAME item was then parsed into SUF.DIR, STREET.NAME, STREET.TYPE, and PRE.DIR, making addressing matching functions a little easier. See the &quot;VT Road Centerline Data FAQ&quot; for more information about TransRoad_RDS and EmergencyE911_RDS. http://vcgi.vermont.gov/techres/?page=./white_papers/default_content.cfm',\n",

In December 2010, the Tigard City Council adopted the 2035 Transportation System Plan (TSP) that links    expected growth with transportation needs. This update is timely for two reasons. First, traffic congestion    has consistently ranked as the number one issue facing Tigard in community attitude surveys and the    City is committed to finding solutions to this issue. Secondly, the community has developed a vision    for Tigard's future and a key component of this vision is developing an efficient and balanced multi-modal    transportation system.      The 2035 TSP sets the policy framework for the city's transportation system. It includes a list of strategies    and projects that will guide future investments. The strategies range from access management, to connectivity    improvements, to &quot;smarter&quot; traffic signals. There are more than 140 identified transportation projects    ranging from sidewalk infill to freeway over-passes. Identification of these transportation projects is    important because in order to qualify for federal transportation funds they must be identified in the TSP.   Transportation funds are limited and highly competitive for large expensive projects. For this reason,    a major theme of this TSP update is the need to make the most out of the existing transportation system.    We believe this can be accomplished through effective management and strategic investments such as    improved street connections, new trails, sidewalks, bicycle facilities, intersection improvements,    and transit service. All of these improvements are aimed at providing safe and efficient transportation    options for the community.For general information visit the City's home page.

Once MTR areas were located and ground truthed against the imagery, the raster file was transferred to ArcMap. ArcMap was used in this project to convert the MTR raster to a vector file and remove areas that were considered interference or noise in the data (not MTR). Areas that may have been spectrally confused with MTR sites include rivers and roads. The MTR data was checked for accuracy by cross referencing 120 random points, producing a total accuracy of 91.75%. The total acreage for MTR in 2010 was 267,306.28 acres.\\n\\nThe data was created as part of a group project through a class offered by University of West Florida (UWF).

The 7 bands of the 2010 Landsat imagery were consolidated using the Composite Bands tool, and the imagery was clipped to the group's study area in ArcMap. A layer with 50 classes was created in ERDAS Imagine using the Unsupervised Classification tool. Areas which appeared to be part of MTR were classed and symbolized by color accordingly with the remaining areas being classed as NonMTR. Many objects such as stream or river banks, buildings, and roads have identical spectral signatures as MTR and were included initially. They were removed from the MTR features later. In ArcMap, the classified image was reclassified with MTR being assigned a value of 1 and all other Class Names assigned blank values.From this information, the MTR raster was converted to polygons. MTR features within 400 meters of major rivers or highways were removed from the MTR polygon layer, as were those within 50 meters of streets and other rivers. Features smaller than 40 acres were removed as well. An accuracy assessment was done with a result of 96.7%, and a comparison against the 2005 dataset was made. There was an overall decrease in acreage attributed to MTR from 2005 to 2010, but the data needs to be critiqued further. The 2005 dataset included features of less than 40 acres, while the 2010 data was restricted to features containing more than 40 acres. The 2005 dataset had more than 8,000 features, while the 2010 dataset had fewer than 500 due to the acreage restriction.\",\n",

In 2014, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and the Pacific Marine and Estuarine Fish Habitat Partnership (PMEP) produced the report, Nursey Functions of U.S. West Coast Estuaries: The State of Knowledge for Juveniles of Focal Invertebrate and Fish Species, which found that eelgrass (Zostera sp.) beds are one of the most important juvenile habitats for a broad array of fish species. Understanding the spatial extent of eelgrass habitats in West Coast estuaries is important for restoration and conservation of this valued habitat. This is not a complete collection of eelgrass data on the West Coast, it is the best available information available at the time of compilation. The extent of eelgrass has been derived from multiple datasets and sources, from data collected over different time periods using a variety of data collection methods. Data sources include Washington Department of Land Conservation and Development''s Submerged Vegetation Monitoring Porgram (SVMP), Island County, Clallam County, Snohomish County, Skagit County, Whatcom County, Pierce County, and Jefferson County, Marine Resource Consultants, United States Geological Survey (USGS), Pacific Northwest National Laboratories (PNNL), Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development''s (DLCD) Estuary Plan Book, the Environmental Protection Agency, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlifes SEACOR program, South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve (SSNERR), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Merkel and Associates, Inc., Tetra Tech, Inc., Point Reyes National Seashore, Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve (ESNERR), California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), California Seagrant, Coastal Resource Management, MBC Applied Environmental Sciences, Ocean Imaging, Golden State Aerial Surveys, Inc., and Pentec.

It is projected that this topology will be verified on an annual basis. Various methods are used to update these features including COGO, tracing images or Assessor Parcel Maps, and CAD to GIS transformation. However, there are many cases where spatial adjustments (eg. rubbersheeting) or best-fit decisions are made to complete updates in a timely manner. At any one time throughout the year, in the vicinity of newly created or modified parcels, there may be slight errors in the topological integrity. Athough every effort is made to maintain the highest level of accuracy during all phases of layer modifications.

The HIFLD Subcommittee was established in 2002 to address improvements in the collection, processing, sharing and protection of National geospatial information across multiple levels of government to help provide a common foundation for data visualization and analysis.\\xa0This dataset represents the locations of hurricane evacuation routes. A hurricane evacuation route is a designated route used to direct traffic inland in case of a hurricane threat.\\xa0This dataset is based on supplied data from Gulf Coast and Atlantic Seaboard states. Each state was contacted by\\xa0Techni Graphic Systems, Inc. (TGS) to determine an official source for hurricane evacuation routes. GIS data was gathered from states willing to share such data. In cases where states were unable or unwilling to share data in this format, TGS requested that the states provide a source for identifying hurricane evacuation routes. The states usually identified a website that made this data available to the public. Three (3) states (ME, NY, and NH) indicated that they do not maintain public maps showing hurricane evacuation routes and were unable or unwilling to share GIS files depicting such routes. Hurricane evacuation routes depicted on non-GIS maps were digitized using aerial ortho imagery while referencing supplied maps. Shape files that depicted hurricane evacuation routes were edge matched and merged with the digitized evacuation routes. All routes identified as primary hurricane evacuation routes were included in this dataset. If a state also designated secondary hurricane evacuation routes, they were included as well. Routes depicted in this dataset are dependent upon what each state identified as a hurricane evacuation route. Criteria used to identify these routes may vary from state to state.Use Cases (Use cases describe how the data may be used and help to define and clarify requirements):A resource for emergency route planning purposes.A resource for situational awareness planning and response for federal government events.A portion of an evacuation route may be rendered unusable due to natural or man made disaster and rerouting of traffic is necessary.An incident has occurred during an evacuation and first responders must quickly deploy to the area.Public awareness.Data downloaded:\\xa0HIFLD Open Data\\xa0- Many field names and data values were converted from all caps to\\xa0proper casingFor more information:\\xa0Homeland Infrastructure Foundation - Level Data SubcommitteeFor additional metadata about the original data:\\xa0ISO-19139 MetadataData currency:\\xa0Caution should be exercised by the user of this feature layer.

To introduce us to identifying proper sites, we were\\r\\ngiven shapefiles that identified MTR sites from 2005 and the imagery that it\\r\\nwas based on. We were then tasked to use this info in Erdas Imagine to zoom in\\r\\non areas that experienced mining so that we could identify unique visual\\r\\nattributes, which we would use later when we were responsible for identifying\\r\\nMTR sites in 2010 that did not come with delineated areas already drawn out for\\r\\nus. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the second half of the project, we were placed groups in\\r\\nwhich we all were responsible for identifying MTR sites in 2010. We were responsible\\r\\nfor a different file (Landsat imagery provided by SkyTruth), but within the\\r\\nsame geographic area. We used the visual cues and tools that we had used from\\r\\nour practice round when analyzing 2005 data. We then reclassified the coloring\\r\\ninto 50 different classes to get a more detailed view, and then edited the\\r\\nAttribute Table in Erdas by identifying each color as either MTR or non non MTR\\r\\nbased on our analysis. We then exported this image to ArcMap and used various\\r\\ntools to rule out landmasses that may have had similar colors or visual cues. To\\r\\nanalyze the accuracy of our image, we created random points within our study\\r\\narea and analyzed them to see if they matched with the correct identification\\r\\nof MTR sites. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter we were done, we exported our final layer to a layer\\r\\npackage and shared with our group. We then merged our data to a final layer\\r\\npackage. I am glad that I worked with a group, because when more people are\\r\\ninvolved in making estimations, the more likely one is to get a more accurate\\r\\naverage since some people tend to overestimate and others tend to\\r\\nunderestimate. I was probably too cautious and underestimated MTR sites, not\\r\\nwanting to make a mistake and identify the wrong thing. My total 2010 acreage\\r\\nwas less than the 2005 acreage data that we were given, but I know that by\\r\\nmerging our data we were able to paint a more complete picture of the data.\\xa0',\n",

       "  'dc_description_s': 'The CalFish Abundance Database contains a comprehensive collection of anadromous fisheries abundance information. The \"Other Fish\" category contains data collected for species other than salmonids, or salmonids that have not been identified as to species. Beginning in 1998, the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, began a cooperative project aimed at collecting, archiving, and entering into standardized electronic formats, the wealth of information generated by fisheries resource management agencies and tribes throughout California. Extensive data are currently available for chinook, coho, steelhead and to a lesser degree other fish species as well. Major data categories include adult abundance population estimates, actual fish and/or carcass counts, counts of fish collected at dams, weirs, or traps, and redd counts. Updates are made to the CalFish web server quarterly. This CalFish Abundance Database shapefile was generated from fully routed 1:100,000 hydrography. In a few cases streams had to be added to the hydrography dataset in order to provide a means to create shapefiles to represent abundance data associated with them. Streams added were digitized at no more than 1:24,000 scale based on stream line images portrayed in 1:24,000 Digital Raster Graphics (DRG). These features generally represent abundance counts resulting from stream surveys. The linear features in this layer typically represent the location for which abundance data records apply. This would be the reach or length of stream surveyed, or the stream sections for which a given population estimate applies. In some cases the actual stream section surveyed was not specified and linear features represent the entire stream. In many cases there are multiple datasets associated with the same length of stream, and so, linear features overlap. Please view the associated datasets for detail regarding specific features. In CalFish these are accessed through the \"link\" that is visible when performing an identify or query operation. A URL string is provided with each feature in the downloadable data which can also be used to access the underlying datasets. The data that is available via the CalFish website is actually linked directly to the StreamNet website where the database\\'\\'s tabular data is currently stored. Additional information about StreamNet may be downloaded at http://www.streamnet.org.

       "  'dc_description_s': 'The CalFish Abundance Database contains a comprehensive collection of anadromous fisheries abundance information. Beginning in 1998, the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, began a cooperative project aimed at collecting, archiving, and entering into standardized electronic formats, the wealth of information generated by fisheries resource management agencies and tribes throughout California.Extensive data are currently available for chinook, coho, and steelhead. Major data categories include adult abundance population estimates, actual fish and/or carcass counts, counts of fish collected at dams, weirs, or traps, and redd counts. Harvest data has been compiled for many streams, and hatchery return data has been compiled for the states mitigation facilities. A draft format has been developed for juvenile abundance and awaits final approval. This CalFish Abundance Database shapefile was generated from fully routed 1:100,000 hydrography. In a few cases streams had to be added to the hydrography dataset in order to provide a means to create shapefiles to represent abundance data associated with them. Streams added were digitized at no more than 1:24,000 scale based on stream line images portrayed in 1:24,000 Digital Raster Graphics (DRG).These features generally represent abundance counts resulting from stream surveys. The linear features in this layer typically represent the location for which abundance data records apply. This would be the reach or length of stream surveyed, or the stream sections for which a given population estimate applies. In some cases the actual stream section surveyed was not specified and linear features represent the entire stream. In many cases there are multiple datasets associated with the same length of stream, and so, linear features overlap. Please view the associated datasets for detail regarding specific features. In CalFish these are accessed through the \"link\" that is visible when performing an identify or query operation. A URL string is provided with each feature in the downloadable data which can also be used to access the underlying datasets.The steelhead data that is available via the CalFish website is actually linked directly to the StreamNet website where the database\\'\\'s tabular data is currently stored. Additional information about StreamNet may be downloaded at http://www.streamnet.org. Complete documentation for the StreamNet database may be accessed at http://www.streamnet.org/def.html',\n",

These contours were accompanied by hydro-flattened Bare Earth DEMs and breaklines. Geographic Extent: AOI was located in Eastern Nebraska over Douglas, Sarpy, and Lancaster Counties. The area of interest covered approximately 1,789 square miles. Dataset Description: NE Nebraska Urban Area Lidar_2016 QL2 Lidar project called for the Planning, Acquisition, processing and derivative products of lidar data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.70 meter. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Lidar Base Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 (2011), Nebraska State Plane (FIPS 2600), U.S. Survey Feet and vertical datum of NAVD88 (GEOID12B), Feet. Lidar data was delivered as; flightline-extent raw LAS v1.4 swaths, classified point cloud LAS v1.4 files formatted to 2,380 individual 5000' x 5000' tiles in NAD83 (2011) Nebraska State Plane (FIPS 2600). Derivatives were produced as tiled; Bare Earth Surface DEMs, Digital Surface Models, Intensity Images; all tiled to the same 5000’ x 5000’ schema. Ground Conditions: Lidar was collected in winter of 2016/17 by Aerial Services, Inc. (ASI), while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Woolpert established a total of 33 ground control points that were used to calibrate the lidar to known ground locations established throughout the project area. Additional independent accuracy checkpoints were collected (76 NVA points and 55 VVA points) and used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data.\",\n",

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc.. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.

Data was sourced by the USDA Forest Service and modified by the Sierra Water Workgroup.\\xa0Original Metadata.This is a derived layer of forestland capability, suitability and availability for timber production. Water is assigned census or non-census water using the water bodies layer. Land is assigned to forest or non-forest using existing vegetation. Forestland both capable (productive) and other (non-productive) forestland, as well as non-forest are determined by CALVEG types (TABLE 38). \\xa0Each CALVEG type is assigned a forest productivity code (TABLE 43). Suitability information is derived from productive forest CALVEG types that are available, minus the unsuitable forestlands (UNSU). Availability (TABLE 11) is derived by determining all forestland from CALVEG type, minus the congressionally withdrawn and pending withdrawal wilderness areas (WILD) and wild and scenic rivers (WSRR). For all lands that are tentatively suitable for timber production, a determination of final forestland allocations under the Forest Plan is made, using all prescription and management layers with a constraint on timber management assigned by the LSC code(s) on each layer (TABLE 29). The most constraining resource is coded for each acre on the National Forest. Deriving LSC final timberland allocation can be shown in a flow chart (LSC Chart).For more information about the Land and Resource Management Plan Areas, please see the USDA Forest Service websites:\\xa0http://www.fs.usda.gov/main/r5/landmanagementVegetation Burn Severity (% change in basal area): This layer depicts vegetation burn severity calibrated to percent change in basal area for selected fires in the Yosemite-Mariposa IRWM region.\\xa0Data was provided by the USDA Forest Service fire and fuels monitoring project to support monitoring of wildland fire and fire regimes.

This data is collected state-wide and used to rank and compare regional environmental quality data. Data was sourced by CA EPA and modified by Sierra Water Workgroup.CalEnviroScreen is a screening methodology that can be used to help identify California communities that are disproportionately burdened by multiple sources of pollution. &quot;The CalEnviroScreen 2.0 scores represent a combined measure of pollution and the potential vulnerability of a population to the effects of pollution. Unlike CalEnviroScreen 1.0, Version 2.0 scores do not include a measure of race/ethnicity in the calculation of the CalEnviroScreen score.&quot; (http://oehha.ca.gov/ej/pdf/CES20RaceEthnicity_05082014.pdf) &quot;CalEnviroscreen 2.0 is the latest iteration of the CalEnviroScreen tool. It uses the same methodology as Version 1.1 except that the two indicators for drinking water and unemployment have been added, and the tool looks at pollution burdens and vulnerabilities in census tracts rather than ZIP codes. The two new indicators incorporate potential burdens to communities posed by contaminants in drinking water and potential social stressors relating to unemployment. The use of census tracts as the geographic scale may allow for a more precise screening of pollution burdens and vulnerabilities in communities. While race and ethnicity will not be used in compiling a score using CalEnviroScreen, the final CalEnviroScreen 2.0 document will contain a section that provides information on the racial and ethnic composition of communities throughout the state. This information will help us to better understand the correlation between race/ethnicity and the pollution burdens facing communities in California. CalEPA and OEHHA are committed to updating and expanding this section as new versions of the tool are released.&quot; (http://oehha.ca.gov/ej/pdf/CES20PublicReview04212014.pdf)Data produced in 2014.CalEnviroScreen 2.0 Drinking Water Quality Score Ranked Percentiles:\\xa0This data illustrates the CalEnviroscreen Drinking Water Quality Score Ranked Percentiles for the Yosemite-Mariposa IRWM region.

This will improve their ability to plan for treatment opportunities while remaining consistent with these objectives.\\xa0Users should be aware that this is done at a landscape level and the status of specific units may differ with more site-specific information. These assessments are not appropriate for compliance and enforcement purposes. Rather, they provide a good representation of the objective criteria that are approaching or have exceeded a given threshold and thereby indicate where a more detailed assessment and/or changes in treatment opportunities are needed.\\xa0Purpose:\\xa0The purpose of these data are to improve the ability of forest planners to plan for treatment opportunities.Descriptions\\xa0of each layer are outlined below.LAYER: Seral (Old) RiskSeral stage assessment\\xa0is a planning tool for evaluating whether the distribution of seral stages within a landscape is sufficient to meet biodiversity conservation objectives.\\xa0The CCLUP implementation process identified the need for a regional biodiversity conservation strategy to maintain ecosystem function and species diversity. The Biodiversity Conservation Strategy\\xa0prepared regional seral stage guidelines to maintain a natural seral stage distribution over the forested portions of BEC variants.Seral Stage Criteria:\\xa0For this project, seral stages were assigned by FLNRO to each forested stand based on the definitions provided in\\xa0the table below. These figures are consistent with table 7 in the July 1996 CCLUP Regional Biodiversity Conservation Strategy.Amalgamate NDT-BEC Units:\\xa0The regional Biodiversity Conservation Strategy (1996) indicated that non-valley bottom BEC units less than 5,000 hectares in size and valley bottom units less than 1,000 hectares are not required to meet all seral stage targets within a specific landscape unit. This is because natural disturbances could potentially alter seral condition across most of the BEC unit due to its small size, thus enabling the amalgamation of small BEC units to assess seral targets.For this analysis, BEC units were amalgamated according to the guidance provided in the BEC Unit Amalgamation Table\\xa0and Regional Biodiversity Conservation Strategy. Amalgamating the small reporting units provides a more appropriate spatial depiction of seral status.Seral Stage ProcessingThe general steps for running the seral stage assessment involved:1)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Assigning seral stage based on the adjusted stand age and the criteria in Table 6;2)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Assigning reporting units as described in section 0; and3)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Creating a seral stage report and map.A Python script was built and run to carry out these steps.LAYER: Road Density RiskAn aquatic ecosystems assessment was conducted for the Cariboo-Chilcotin in 2015 to assess broad objectives for: water quantity, water quality and stream-riparian systems. The aquatic ecosystems protocol\\xa0is comprised of an initial set of indicators intended to capture different aspects of watershed function and inform a range of watershed management decisions relating to mitigating the impacts of localized development pressures. As one of the values assessed under the Cumulative Effects Framework,\\xa0this protocol describes the derivation of a core set of watershed indicators that can be calculated consistently across the province using GIS data layers readily available from GeoBC or other ministry providers.Aquatic Ecosystems Assessment Criteria:The aquatic ecosystems assessment was conducted for 1889 analysis units (watershed units) on six benchmarked indicators, one of which is:Road Density - Roads (km) per square kilometer of watershed.Aquatic Ecosystems Processing:\\xa0The 2015 analysis was used in this project by applying the normalized roll-up score (assigned a single for each of the six benchmarked indicators assessed) for each assessment watershed. This roll-up value was used to classify watershed units according to relative risk to further disturbance.LAYER:\\xa0Moose RiskA moose habitat risk assessment is part of a decision support tool - a cumulative impact assessment recently conducted for the Cariboo-Chilcotin\\xa0- designed to assess relative environmental risk to large areas of land and water. This assists in determining impacts and mitigation measures.Moose Habitat Risk Assessment Criteria:\\xa0In this project, recent results from a cumulative impact assessment were used to provide a broad scale assessment of moose habitat risk. Three components of risk were rated for each assessment unit:1)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Ecological Importance\\xa0evaluates the ecological importance of each assessment unit for each VEC. This factor can also be thought of as the level of ecological consequence if the value is impacted.2)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Hazard\\xa0evaluates the current state of the landscape and its ability to meet habitat requirements for each VEC. The assessment is a snapshot in time, evaluating the current ecological condition prior to the consideration of the effects of any new project or development.3)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Current Mitigation\\xa0evaluates the level of risk reduction currently in place for each VEC. Mitigation measures include mapped, legal land-use designations that specify protection or special management requirements. Examples include mule deer winter ranges, protected areas and riparian reserves.The moose habitat risk assessment was conducted for 324 analysis units derived from the Fresh Water Atlas – Assessment Watersheds spatial data.Moose Habitat Risk Processing:\\xa0In this assessment units are assigned the highest assessment class derived from the risk ratings shown in Table 5. For example, an assessment unit with high ecological importance rating, medium hazard rating, and very low current migration rating, would be assigned an assessment class 2 due to the high ecological importance rating.Assessment Class Assignment by Habitat Risk RatingAssessment ClassColour CodeAssessment Risk RatingEcological ImportanceHazardCurrent Mitigation1RedVery HighVery HighVery Low2OrangeHighHighLow3YellowMediumMediumMedium4GreenLowLowHigh5WhiteVery LowVery LowVery HighNote1: the highest risk rating observed is used to assign class/colour code.Note2: current mitigation is sorted inversely.\\xa0LAYER: Wildfire RiskThe wildfire threat rating integrated three identified components of fire threat: fire occurrence (fire density); suppression effort and fire impacts (head fire intensity); and spotting. Results of the final Wildfire Threat Analysis were assigned to 10 classes (Table 4) to produce a detailed map of fire threats throughout BC. These 10 classes represent a subjective best estimate of relative fire threats, taking into account fire occurrence history, predicted fire intensity under extreme conditions, and spotting impact.Wildfire Threat DescriptionWildfire Threat ClassExtreme9 to 10High7 to 8Moderate4 to 6Low1 to 3No Threat (Alpine/Ice/Rock)0No Threat (Water)-1No Data (Private Managed Forest Land)-2* Area-weighted average wildfire threat class calculated for watershed reporting unitsThe 10 Fire Threat Classes represent increasing levels of overall fire threat. Areas classified with wildlife threat above six (high/extreme) are locations where the fire intensity, frequency and spotting risks can be severe enough to potentially cause catastrophic losses in any given wildfire season, if those ratings overlap with significant values at risk. These areas are considered to be particularly prone to wildfires and are most in need of mitigation, where it is feasible to do so based on the fuel types present in those areas.WUI areas were prepared as a two-kilometer buffer zone from known infrastructure to identify and prioritize areas for potential fuel modification. Treatments to manage fuel within WUIs are administered through Strategic Wildfire Prevention Initiative programs – outside the scope of this project. Therefore, opportunities identified through this project are identified throughout the project area but summarized for areas beyond WUI areas.\\xa0',\n",

Sophisticated methodologies were adopted for (1) identifying the spatial distribution of buildings in each country, (2) estimating building characteristics, and (3) assessing their unit replacement costs. Raw building datasets, which included approximately 80,000 field surveyed buildings across 11 countries, was critically analyzed and thoroughly processed to develop the building exposure database. The spatial location of buildings for all populated areas of each 15 PIC was assembled with a high level of resolution that balance accuracy and economy. In general, buildings were either (1) manually digitized from high-resolution satellite imagery and surveyed in the field (coverage: PG, TO, VU, TV, SB, WS, CK, FJ, KI, PW, and FM), (2) manually digitized from high-resolution satellite imagery but not field verified (coverage: All 15 countries), (3) inferred using image processing techniques and/or census data (coverage: PG, FJ, KI, SB, TL, VU, FM, MH, and, to a lesser extent, SB, CK, TO, and TV), or (4) extracted from datasets acquired from government sources.

       "  'dc_description_s': 'Aerial Information Systems, Inc. (AIS) was contracted by the Western Riverside County Regional Conservation Authority to perform an update to their original 2005 Western Riverside Vegetation Map. The project was funded through a Local Assistance Grant from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). The original vegetation layer was created in 2005 using a baseline image dataset created from 2000/01 Emerge imagery flown in early spring. The original map has been used to monitor and evaluate the habitat in the Western Riverside County Multi-species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP). An update to the original map was needed to address changes in vegetation makeup that have occurred in the intervening years due to widespread and multiple burns in the mapping area, urban expansion, and broadly occurring vegetation succession.The update conforms to the standards set by the National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS) published in 2008 by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. (FGDC-STD-005-2008, Vegetation Subcommittee, Federal Geographic Data Committee, February 2008) The update also adheres to the vegetation types as represented in the 2008-second edition of the Manual of California Vegetation (MCV2). Extensive ground based field data both within and nearby the western Riverside County mapping area has been acquired since the completion of the project in 2005. This additional data has resulted in the reclassification of several vegetation types that are addressed in the updated vegetation map. The mapping area covers 1,017,364 acres of the original 1.2 million acres mapped in the 2005 study. The new study covers portions of the Upper Santa Ana River Valley, Perris Plain, and the foothills of the San Jacinto and Santa Ana Mountains but excludes US Forest Service land. The final geodatabase includes an updated 2012 vegetation map. Vegetative and cartographic comparisons between the newly created 2012 image-based map and the original vegetation map produced in 2005 are described in this report.The Update mapping was performed using baseline digital imagery created in 2012 by the US Department of Agriculture – Farm Service Agency’s National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP). Vegetation units were mapped using the National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS) to the Alliance and Association level as depicted in the MCV2. Approximately 55% of the study area is classified to vegetated or naturally occurring sparsely vegetated types; the remaining 45% is unvegetated, with over a third (36%) in urban development and an additional 9% in agriculture. The major tasks for the Update project consisted of updating the original mapping classification to conform to the changes and refinements to the MCV2 classification, updating the existing vegetation map to 2012 conditions, retroactively correcting the 2005 vegetation interpretations, creating the final report and project metadata, and producing the final vegetation geodatabase. After completion of the original 2005 vegetation map, CDFW crosswalked the original mapping units to the NVCS hierarchical names as defined in the Manual of California Vegetation (MCV).The original crosswalk was revised during the Update effort to reflect changes in the original MCV classification as depicted in the second edition (MCV2). Changes were minor and did not result in a significant effort in the updating process. The updating process in many steps is similar to the creation of the original vegetation map. First, photo interpreters review the study area for terrain, environmental features, and probable vegetation types present. Questionable photo signatures on the new baseline imagery (2012 NAIP) were compared to the original 2000/01 Emerge imagery. Photo signatures for a given vegetation polygon were correlated between the two image datasets. Production level updates to the linework and labeling commenced following the correlation of the two baseline image datasets and the subsequent refinement of photo interpretation criteria and biogeographical descriptions of the types. Existing datasets depicting topography, fire history, climate and past vegetation gathering efforts aided photo interpreters in their delineations and floristic assignments during the updating effort. The production updating effort took approximately 11 months.',\n",

The description from the source layer follows:Napa County has used a 2004 edition vegetation map produced using the Manual of California Vegetation classification system (Thorne et al. 2004) as one of the input layers for land use decision and policy. The county decided to update the map because of its utility. A University of California, Davis (UCD) group was engaged to produce the map.The earlier map used black and white digital orthophoto quadrangles from 1993, with a pixel resolution of 3 meters. This image was delineated using a heads up digitization technique produced by ASI (Aerial Services Incorporated). The resulting polygons were the provided vegetation and landcover attributes following the classification system used by California State Department of Fish and Wildlife mappers in the Manual of California Vegetation. That effort included a brief field campaign in which surveyors drove accessible roads and verified or corrected the dominant vegetation of polygons adjacent to roadways or visible using binoculars. There were no field relevé or rapid assessment plots conducted.This update version uses a 2016 edition of 1 meter color aerial imagery taken by the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) as the base imagery. In consultation with the county we decided to use similar methods to the previous mapping effort, in order to preserve the capacity to assess change in the county over time. This meant forgoing recent data and innovations in remote sensing such as the use LiDAR and Ecognition’s segmentation of imagery to delineate stands, which have been recently used in a concurrent project mapping of Sonoma County. The use of such technologies would have made it more difficult to track changes in landcover, because differences between publication dates would not be definitively attributable to either actual land cover change or to change in methodology. The overall cost of updating the map in the way was approximately 20% of the cost of the Sonoma vegetation mapping program.Therefore, we started with the original map, and on-screen inspections of the 2004 polygons to determine if change had occurred. If so, the boundaries and attributes were modified in this new edition of the map. We also used the time series of imagery available on Google Earth, to further inspect many edited polygons. While funding was not available to do field assessments, we incorporated field expertise and other map data from four projects that overlap with parts of Napa Count: the Angwin Experimental Forest; a 2014 vegetation map of the Knoxville area; agricultural rock piles were identified by Amber Manfree; and parts of a Sonoma Vegetation Map that used 2013 imagery.The Angwin Experimental Forest was mapped by Peter Lecourt from Pacific Union College. He identified several polygons of redwoods in what are potentially the eastern-most extent of that species. We reviewed those polygons with him and incorporated some of the data from his area into this map.The 2014 Knoxville Vegetation map was developed by California Department of Fish and Wildlife. It was made public in February of 2019, close to the end of this project. We reviewed the map, which covers part of the northeast portion of Napa County. We incorporated polygons and vegetation types for 18 vegetation types including the rare ones, we reviewed and incorporated some data for another 6 types, and we noted in comments the presence of another 5 types. There is a separate report specifically addressing the incorporation of this map to our map.Dr Amber Manfree has been conducting research on fire return intervals for parts of Napa County. In her research she identified that large piles of rocks are created when vineyards are put in. These are mapable features. She shared the locations of rock piles she identified, which we incorporated into the map.The Sonoma Vegetation Map mapped some distance into the western side of Napa County. We reviewed that map’s polygons for coast redwood. We then examined our imagery and the Google imagery to see if we could discern the whorled pattern of tree branches. Where we could, we amended or expanded redwood polygons in our map.The Vegetation classification systems used here follows California’s Manual of California Vegetation and the National Vegetation Classification System (MCV and NVCS). We started with the vegetation types listed in the 2004 map. We predominantly use the same set of species names, with modifications/additions particularly from the Knoxville map. The NVCS uses Alliance and Association as the two most taxonomically detailed levels. This map uses those levels. It also refers to vegetation types that have not been sampled in the field and that has 3-6 species and a site descriptor as Groups, which is the next more general level in the NVCS classification.We conducted 3 rounds of quality assessment/quality control exercises.',\n",

       "  'dc_description_s': 'BAARI (Bay Area Aquatic Resource Inventory) was established to meet regional needs for wetlands and stream monitoring. One primary objective was to apply standardized monitoring tools to ensure data comparability and consistent, documented quality. These data help agencies and organizations assess the extent and condition of wetlands in local watersheds and identify and prioritize opportunities for ecological restoration and enhancement in a watershed context.BackgroundBAARI data is part of the Wetland and Riparian Area Monitoring Plan (WRAMP), which consists of a 1-2-3 level monitoring framework. This allows assessment of wetlands at two scales: landscape and highly localized. BAARI is Level 1 of this framework, developed for landscape level analyses of wetland extent, distribution and abundance. Geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing are used to map and create inventories of existing wetlands (both modern and historical). These inventories quantify the extent of wetland habitats and projects, and are used for landscape profiles of wetlands at the state, regional, watershed, and local scales. Level 2 entails rapid field assessment of wetland health or ecological condition. In California the California Rapid Assessment Method (CRAM) is a diagnostic tool that two or more trained practitioners can use to assess the condition of a wetland or riparian site in one half day or less using visual indicators in the field. Level 3 monitoring entails intensive sampling of ecological function or specific aspects of wetland condition. These assessments are intensive quantitative measurements of condition, stress, or cause-and-effect relationships. A Level 3 assessment is an in-depth study of a particular attribute of wetland health such as water quality, fish habitat, bird populations, vegetative cover and diversity, or physical processes. Level 3 monitoring can describe the performance of specific ecological functions at the site scale. Information on the WRAMP is available at http://www.mywaterquality.ca.gov/eco_health/wetlands/condition/wramp_toolkit.shtmlMore information on BAARI can be found online at: http://www.sfei.org/BAARI. Description of Updates in Version 2Local experts provided advice on and reviewed BAARI’s stream, wetland and riparian GIS layers in specific locations to help update the data as conditions in the field changed and/or to increase its accuracy and detail. Improving the accuracy and detail of BAARI improves the base maps for all monitoring and assessment efforts to understand the distribution, amount and ecological condition of Bay Area aquatic resources. The following updates were made to BAARI under this project:The Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD) provided their GIS based stream data for the Guadalupe River Watershed. SFEI’s GIS team incorporated parts of the SCVWD dataset into BAARI to improve the accuracy and detail of the BAARI stream layer with the Guadalupe River watershed. Updates included features such as underground connectors between the upper and lower watershed reaches, and enhanced details of portions of the upper watershed. Watershed Sciences developed six hand-drawn maps showing field verified ditch locations circa 2006. Those data were used in developing the sediment TMDL for the watershed. Watershed sciences provided those maps to SFEI’s GIS team and worked with them to compare the remotely sensed stream and ditch locations in the BAARI data set (based on 2009 NAIP imagery) to her maps and other data (including Google Earth using multiple image dates). Based on this careful comparative process, about 500 linear updates were made to the BAARI stream layer for the Sonoma Creek watershed with the data source attributed to Laurel Collins’ maps. SFEI staff added stream names for the whole BAARI dataset (Bay Area 9 counties, ocean shoreline, and Tomales Bay - 530 different names applied to more than 24000 stream segments).Additional corrections to wetland and stream presence, extent, and classification were appended to the dataset by SFEI staff where inaccuracies were identified based on local expertise of wetlands in the Bay Area.All BAARI updates were reviewed by a second GIS staff member to ensure that they were acceptable and followed BAARI mapping protocols.

The data is derived from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Homeland Infrastructure Foundation Level Data (HIFLD).\\xa0A collaboration among USGS scientists related to energy development and environmental consequences began in 2008. This group anticipated finding accurate information on wind energy facilities and turbines in the public sphere, like the type of data available for oil and gas wells. However, turbine information was lacking, and it became apparent that scientists, regulatory agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and other decision-makers all needed spatially accurate wind turbine information. Each of the 1,737 turbine locations includes corresponding facility information and turbine technical specifications.Electric substations are facilities and equipment that switch, transform or regulate electric voltage. The electric substation feature class in this service includes taps, which are locations where power on a transmission line is tapped by another transmission line. Electric substations are part of the electric network system helping to move electricity\\xa0to where it is needed.Electric power transmission lines are the system of structures, wires, insulators and associated hardware that carry electric power from one point to another in an electric power network. Lines are operated at high voltages varying from 69 kV (Kilo Volts) up to 765 kV and can transmit large quantities of electricity over long distances.

       "  'dc_description_s': \"Coastal wetlandsCoastal wetlands come in many forms and can be freshwater, brackish or saline. This page describes the features of different\\xa0coastal wetland types.Estuarine lakes and lagoonsA large open body of saline or brackish water which has a relatively narrow permanent or intermittent connection to the sea. Many coastal lakes and lagoons alternate between being open or closed to the ocean. These are known as Intermittently Closed and Open Lakes and Lagoons (ICOLLs).\\xa0More about ICOLLs ...ExamplesMyall LakesLake MacquarieWooloweyah Lagoon (Clarence River system)St Georges BasinBurril LakeFeaturesOccur all along the NSW coast but are most extensive on the south coast. They are separated from the estuary or ocean by a barrier sand dune, and have a connection (usually intermittent) with the sea.The water can vary from brackish to as saline as sea water.Many coastal waterbodies are only open to the sea during floods or at very high tides. Due to the irregular connections with the sea they are usually characterised by changes in water levels.Lakes and lagoons that are more frequently open to the sea usually have submerged seagrass beds such as\\xa0Zostera capricorni\\xa0in the north or\\xa0Zostera muelleri\\xa0in the south.Less saline lagoons usually support species of sea tassel that often grows in association with stonewort.Shallow edges are usually dominated by emergent plants such as common reeds or sedges.Myall Lakes.

Photo: NSW DPIFeaturesEstuarine areas subject to tidal flooding which support mangrove and saltmarsh vegetation or non-tidal basins which occur on estuarine sediments adjacent to mangrove and saltmarsh areas, as well as any mudflats and small creeks which occur within or adjacent to the communityFound along tidal shorelines which are exposed to seawater. They often extend up coastal rivers as far as the tidal limit.Mangrove and saltmarsh often occur in association with one another, with saltmarsh communities occurring on the landward side of mangroves.Dependant on periodic tidal inundation. In NSW, mangroves dominate those areas inundated daily, whereas saltmarsh vegetation occurs in areas less frequently flooded.Grey mangrove (Avicennia marina) is the dominant species within NSW and is present along the entire coastline.Within saltmarsh communities there is often a distinct zonation of vegetation across the wetland according to frequency of inundation from the sea. A typical zonation from sea to land is samphire, salt couch and salt rush. Swamp sheoak may be found growing in or on the landward margins of the marsh.Mangrove wetland, Wongonga Inlet, Narooma. Photo: Trevor DalyHexham swamp, an example of a saltmarsh. Photo: Scott Machar.Dune swamps and lagoonsExamplesLakes, lagoons, shallow vegetated basins, heaths and forests.Coomonderry Swamp, east of NowraLake Ainsworth, Lennox HeadFeaturesOccur on coastal sand dunes or plains behind the present beach and foredune.Dependant on groundwater and runoff from local catchments.The waters of dunal lakes and swamps are often tea-coloured and acidic as a result of dissolved organic matter from peaty soils.Vegetation of dunal wetlands is distinctive although some species also occur on coastal floodplains. Seasonally flooded areas with a high watertable support a woodland or forest of broad-leaved paperbark. Paperbarks may also be found in swamps behind the foredune and sporadically around the perched swamps and lakes. Other vegetation typical of dune wetlands include sedges, rushes and wet heathland. The sedge species,\\xa0Lepironia articulate, is common around the margins of perched lakes and may grow in water up to 6m deep.Upland lakes and lagoonsLarge or small bodies of freshwater occurring usually in low hills or mountains.ExamplesLake GeorgeThirlmere LakesLake BathurstFeaturesConsist predominantly of open water, with vegetation, if present, confined to the margins of the wetland.Occur predominantly on the tablelands. On the tablelands of NSW upland lakes and lagoons occur in two main areas - the New England Plateau and the southern tablelands including the Monaro region. However any waterbody on the coastal or inland plains (apart from arid wetlands) which fills though a local catchment, groundwater or rainfall (i.e. is not flooded from a river) can be classed an upland lake.Upland waterbodies are found in depressions formed by erosion of the underlying bedrock, in depressions associated with past fault activity and in depressions scoured by past glacial activity.Water is sourced from groundwater, rainfall and/ or runoff from local catchments.Large internally draining lakes do not support much aquatic vegetation, although at times may have submerged growths of sea tassel, ribbonweed,\\xa0Lepilaena\\xa0spp. and water milfoils. Marginal vegetation is usually sparse and restricted to common reed, cumbungi, sedges and rushes. In the smaller lakes and lagoons of the New England and southern tablelands, tall spikerush is a common species in the more permanently inundated parts of the lake. A variety of species may be found growing around the less frequently inundated edges, including blown grass, knotweeds and water milfoil. Glacial lakes are generally devoid of any aquatic vegetationThirlmere Lakes. Photo: Dayle GreenLake George is typical of most of the large lakes which are perennial and subject to large reductions in area and depth during dry periods. Photo: NSW DLWCBlue Lake is a glacial lake. Glacial lakes are permanent as a result of high inflows from snowmelt and rainfall runoff combined with low evaporation. Photo: Dayle GreenUpland swampVegetated freshwater wetlands including shallow marshes, sedge swamps, &quot;hanging&quot; swamps, wet heaths and peat swamps.ExamplesBega SwampWingecarribee SwampCathedral Rock National ParkFeaturesOccur in shallow basins located in low hills or mountains, predominantly on or adjacent to the tablelands.Rely on groundwater, rainfall and runoff from a small local catchment for their source of water.May hold water permanently, or may fill on a seasonal or intermittent basis.Most tableland swamps have some degree of peat development.On the sandstone plateau's surrounding Sydney and the granite plateau of the New England area, &quot;hanging swamps&quot; of sedge and heath occur on valley sides. That is, where groundwater discharge occurs as a result of impermeable layers in the bedrock. Swamps may also occur on valley-fill deposits eroded from the surrounding ridges. In other parts of the tablelands, such as the Monaro region, swamps are found within shallow depressions formed through erosion of the underlying bedrock.The hanging swamps of the sandstone and granite plateaus are dominated by a mix of sedges, grasses and shrubs, generally with sedges occurring in the wettest areas. Sedge swamps tend to be dominated by members of the Cyperaceae family (commonly, razor sedge, button bog-rush, fringed cord-rush and slender yellow-eye). Common shrub species include teatrees, bottlebrush, hakea, banksia and melaleuca.Swamps with deep peat beds are typically restricted to acid fens and bogs. Acid fens occur where the water has a relatively higher mineral content and are dominated by sedges (usually\\xa0Carex\\xa0spp.).Where minerals are more deficient hummocks of sphagnum moss form valley bogs. The bogs are characterised by an uneven surface due to alternate hollows and hummocks of moss. The hummocks are formed above the water level by sphagnum moss or in less humid environments\\xa0Blindia\\xa0spp. or\\xa0Bryum\\xa0spp. The wet hollows in between contain a carpet of other mosses such as\\xa0Polytrichumspp. and\\xa0Breutelia\\xa0spp.Coastal floodplain forestA wetland located on the floodplain of a coastal river which is dominated by trees.ExamplesYarrahappinni Wetland, Macleay RiverTuckean Swamp, Richmond RiverFeaturesOccur on the sandy sediments located on the lower reaches of coastal floodplains.Rely on brief seasonal flooding from rivers as their main source of water.The dominant species of coastal floodplain forests is the broad-leaved paperbark. Forests of swamp she-oak typically occur along the lower reaches of coastal rivers and estuaries. Understorey species typically include rushes (Juncus\\xa0spp.),\\xa0Villarsia\\xa0spp., common reed, water ribbon,\\xa0Maundia triglochinoides\\xa0and\\xa0Persicaria strigosa\\xa0and grasses (matgrass, spiney mudgrass, swamp rice grass and watercouch).Coastal floodplain swamps and lagoonsThis wetland type includes shallow marshes and meadows, as well as deeper ponds and billabongs which have large areas of open water.ExamplesBelmore Swamp, Macleay RiverEverlasting Swamp, Clarence RiverFeaturesLocated on the floodplain of a coastal river.They can form in a number of ways:Where the floodplain gradually slopes away from the river and abuts an adjacent terrace or hill on the edge of the floodplain (a &quot;backswamp&quot;).As a ponded tributary where the river levee has dammed the junction of a smaller tributary.As a billabong resulting from the cut-off of a river bend.As a floodway or some other form of flood channel which is not connected to the river during normal flows.Rely on seasonal or intermittent flooding from a river as their main source of water. Local runoff contributes to the maintenance of some lagoons between floods while small ponds may fill after heavy rainfall.The vegetation in coastal swamps and lagoons is very dynamic and can change in response to seasonal fluctuations in water depth.Marginal species of coastal floodplain lagoons include jointed twig-rush,\\xa0Lepidosperma\\xa0spp., spikerushes, cumbungi, water ribbon and frogsmouth.Reasonably permanent lagoons may support submerged species such as ribbonweed, bladderwort, watermilfoil, and pondweed. Floating aquatic species include water primrose, swamp lily, waterlilies, duckweed and azolla.Coastal floodplain meadows which are continuously flooded over summer and autumn support a complex community including knotweeds, sedges and many emergent aquatic species.Cattle grazing a swamp in the Clarence River floodplain.A typical floodplain swamp when flooded.\",\n",

The intent of this data is to provide emergency services with the earliest address plan for new developments even while the development is under construction.Street centerlines are initially digitized from center of right-of-ways shown on survey plats and are then updated when a new orthophoto becomes available. Unnamed roads, driveways, planned roads, alleys are only intended for graphic display. These segments are generally not topologically connected to addressed streets. This feature class is used as the street centerline source for TCOMM911 Operations Center (CAPCOM) CAD/Ti Geo file load and Maverick Map data. As of 1/06, edits in this data regarding exact street name and begin/end address ranges are also entered in the County's Master Street Address Guide through Intrado's 911Net database maintenance request site.Layer/Field\\xa0Explanation:Street centerlines are initially digitized from center of right-of-ways shown on preliminary plats and updated in final survey plats. If this source is delivered in hard copy, then the document will be scanned and the image georectified using common parcel corners found in the source and in the County parcel layer. Some centerlines are imported directly from digital survey drawings. When a new orthophoto becomes available, the centerlines are reviewed again and adjusted and/or vertex weeded as necessary.Theoretical address ranges are used to extend valid ranges beyond physical addresses. This will influence the positional quality of geocoded points if used as a reference source. It should be noted that the County Development Services Addressing Department does not assign house numbers where the right two digits exceed the number 49. For emergency services, address ranges need to be continuous where the physical street is continuous and maintain 100 block interval changes at intersections. As a result, geocoded points are likely to be skewed toward the lower end of each address range.Zero address ranges will not be used on any name/addressed street types. Any named and signed road without address ranges will default to a 100-199 address range Speed Limit- This attribute was created using the best available information at the time. Use with caution. Limited access segments (I5 and US 101) have been assigned address ranges based on mile post location. Decimal house numbers are not valid so mile post address ranges have been multiplied by 100.CITY_L and CITY_R are used to define msag community, not postal community. Unincorporated areas and those within the City of Olympia are given the community of 'OL'. A list is posted to the County GeoData Center showing unique street names selected by all jurisdictions within the county for addressing officers to consult in selecting street names, http://www.geodata.org/capcom.aspx. Capcom's policy requires that new street names are unique regardless of jurisdiction and street type. Unnamed roads, unofficially named roads, driveways and alleys are identified as TYPE=5.Special characters in street names are not valid. Hyphens are generally replaced with a space character.Forest roads within Capitol Forest are being captured with proper WA DNR road identification based on DNR map. The address range applied to forest roads is based on distance in miles x 100 from the trunk in which branching road extends.\",\n",

To map IFL areas, a set of criteria was developed and designed to be globally applicable and easily replicable, the latter to allow for repeated assessments over time as well as verification. IFL areas were defined as unfragmented landscapes, at least 50,000 hectares in size, and with a minimum width of 10 kilometers. These were mapped from Landsat satellite imagery for the year 2000.Changes in the extent of IFLs were identified from 2000-2013 and from 2013-2016 within the original year 2000 IFL boundary using the global wall-to-wall Landsat image composite for years 2013, 2016, and the global forest cover loss dataset (Hansen et al., 2013). Areas identified as “reduction in extent” met the IFL criteria in 2000, but no longer met the criteria in 2013 or 2016. The main causes of change were clearing for agriculture and tree plantations, industrial activity such as logging and mining, fragmentation due to infrastructure and new roads, and fires assumed to be caused by humans. This data can be used to assess forest intactness, alteration, and degradation at global and regional scales.\"',\n",

The UCR program collects statistics on the number of violent crime offenses known to law enforcement. There are several violent crimes that fall into the category of Part 1 Offenses including: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft and larceny-theft.

The CAD file was created by digitizing the RICA Maps of Pompeii, 1984, supported by World Monuments Watch and funded by American Express. The RICA MAPs were drawn in part from aerial images taken at 820m and supplemented by on the ground survey. Inconsistencies among the features of this layer with satellite imagery or other maps of Pompeii may be the result of errors in the rectification of the original aerial images and differences projected between coordinate systems (PBMP data are in the Monte_Mario_Italy_2 projected coordinate system).

The U.S. natural gas pipeline network is a highly integrated\\xa0network that moves natural gas throughout the continental United States. The pipeline network has about 3 million miles of mainline and other pipelines that link natural gas production areas and storage facilities with consumers. This natural gas transportation network delivered more than 25 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of natural gas in 2016 to about 74 million customers.There are two types of natural gas networks within the United States. The largest system is the interstate pipeline system which means the pipelines cross one or more states. Two-thirds of the lower 48 States are almost totally dependent upon the interstate pipeline system for their supplies of natural gas. Today, almost every major metropolitan area in the United States is supplied by, or is the final destination of, one or more of the major interstate pipeline companies or their affiliates.The other type of natural gas pipelines existing within the United States are the intrastate natural gas pipeline networks. Intrastate natural gas pipelines operate within State borders and link natural gas producers to local markets and to the interstate pipeline network. Approximately 29 percent of the total miles of natural gas pipelines in the U.S. are intrastate pipelines. Although an intrastate pipeline system is defined as one that operates totally within a State, an intrastate pipeline company may have operations in more than one State. As long as these operations are separate, that is, they do not physically interconnect, they are considered intrastate, and are not jurisdictional\\xa0to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). More than 90 intrastate natural gas pipelines operate in the lower 48 States.\\xa0The source pipeline data was created by EIA using publicly available data from a variety of sources with varying scales and levels of accuracy.Interstate and Intrastate Gas PipelinesData currency: April, 19, 2018Data Download:\\xa0MAPSFor more information, please visit:\\xa0Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline Segment\\xa0and\\xa0Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline SegmentFor feedback please contact:\\xa0ArcGIScomNationalMaps@esri.comThumbnail image courtesy of\\xa0NPCA OnlineOther Federal User Community federally focused content that may interest you\\xa0U.S. Department of Energy\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Energy Information Administration\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: USDOE\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Open Data: EIA\\xa0',\n",

For Elementary School Districts the general grade range varies. Elementary can mean grades 1 through 6 and grades 7 and 8. While Elementary and Secondary School Districts can overlap, neither will ever overlap with a Unified School District.Seaside Park Borough School DistrictFor data:\\xa0USCBData Currency: August, 2015.For feedback please contact:\\xa0ArcGIScomNationalMaps@esri.comThumbnail image courtesy of\\xa0U.S. Army Corp of Engineers',\n",

This\\nfile is currently under construction and should be used for reference purposes\\nonly. \\n\\nData History: The attribute data for these features were\\nderived from the nomenclature system in the Pompei.\\nPitture e Mosaici volumes and digitized in CAD by students at the\\nUniversity of Massachusetts Amherst. Information on room names were then added\\nto the attribute table using a RegionInsulaDoorwayRoom system (e.g., VI1736B).\\nSpatial data in this layer are based on a CAD file provided by the\\nSoprintendenza di Pompei to Eric Poehler in 2003. The CAD file was created by\\ndigitizing the RICA Maps of Pompeii, 1984, supported by World Monuments Watch\\nand funded by American Express. The RICA MAPs were drawn in part from aerial\\nimages taken at 820m and supplemented by on the ground survey. Inconsistencies\\namong the features of this layer with satellite imagery or other maps of\\nPompeii may be the result of errors in the rectification of the original aerial\\nimages and differences projected between coordinate systems (PBMP data are in\\nthe Monte_Mario_Italy_2 projected coordinate system).

A national digital geologic map database is essential in interpreting other datasets that support numerous types of national-scale studies and assessments, such as those that provide geochemistry, remote sensing, or geophysical data.\\xa0The SGMC is a compilation of the individual USGS releases of the Preliminary Integrated Geologic Map Databases for the U.S. It also contains updated data for seven states and seven entirely new state geologic maps that have been added since the preliminary databases were published. Numerous errors have been corrected and enhancements added to the preliminary datasets using thorough quality assurance/quality control procedures. The SGMC is not a truly integrated geologic map database because geologic units have not been reconciled across state boundaries. However, the geologic data contained in each state geologic map have been standardized to allow spatial analyses of lithology, age, and stratigraphy at a national scale.\\xa0A full discussion of the procedures and methodology used to create this dataset is available in the accompanying report: Horton, J.D., San Juan, C.A., and Stoeser, D.B, 2017,\\xa0The State Geologic Map Compilation (SGMC) geodatabase of the conterminous United States\\xa0(ver. 1.1, August 2017): U.S. Geological Survey Data Series 1052, 46 p.SGMC GeologyData currency: June 30, 2017Data modification: NoneFor more information:\\xa0The State Geologic Map Compilation (SGMC) Geodatabase of the Conterminous United StatesFor feedback please contact:\\xa0ArcGIScomNationalMaps@esri.comThumbnail source image courtesy of:\\xa0Doc SearlsOther Federal User Community content and data that may interest youDepartment of the InteriorU.S Geological Survey',\n",

Since housing assistance is provided on behalf of the family or individual, participants can find their own housing, including single-family homes, townhouses and apartments.Housing choice vouchers (HCV) are administered locally by public housing agencies (PHA). The PHAs receive federal funds from HUD to administer the voucher program. When a family or individual finds a suitable housing unit a subsidy is paid to the landlord directly by the PHA. The family or individual then pays the difference between the actual rent charged by the landlord and the amount subsidized by the program. HCV locations are identified in public records by the owner and not the tenant so access to this information is restricted to help safeguard the location of HCV units. Due to the sensitive nature of the HCV locations, the HCVs are aggregated to the 2010 Census Tract geography.Housing Choice Vouchers Public PercentageData Currency: Current Federal Service\\xa0(See\\xa0Service Description\\xa0for currency date)Data Modifications: NoneFor more information:\\xa0Housing Choice Voucher ProgramFor feedback please contact:\\xa0ArcGIScomNationalMaps@esri.comThumbnail image courtesy of:\\xa0David SawyerA-16 Data SetThis data set is part of the Office of Management and Budget's Circular A-16 &quot;Real Property Theme&quot;.\\xa0\\xa0OMB Circular A-16 is a federal government circular created to provide guidance for federal agencies that create, maintain or use spatial data directly or indirectly.To access other content that may interest you\\xa0A-16 Content\\xa0Data is current as of: 09/30/2016\",\n",
